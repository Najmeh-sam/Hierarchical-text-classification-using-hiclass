PetSafe Staywell Pet Door with Clear Hard Flap,We've only had it installed about 2 weeks. So far it works great. My chubby collie & old black lab are both going in and out easily.

Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,"I was looking for a toy my dog would love and would entertain her both while we were home and playing with her AND while we weren't home.SHE ADORES this toy!!! My dog is an Australian Shepherd, 8 years old and loves her toys!!First, I love that it has the 'hunting' element to it. She will stick her entire nose/face into the holes to get the last squirrel/chipmunk!! It's so cute.When I put all three in she will grab it and shake it violently (as in going in for the kill) and they fling out one at a time!!! Hilarious to watch.Then, I LOVE that the each squeak!!! And so does my dog. She will pounce on them and chew it to hear it squeak!!This has quickly become one of her FAVORITE TOYS, and believe me, she has quite a lot of them. When we tell her to get 'Chippy' (we think they look more like chipmunks) she runs over to the toy and pounces!!!Then, when she is more calm or tired, she will cuddle with them as well.I bought this for her last Christmas (2011) and she plays with it constantly and ROUGH and it is still in GREAT condition!!!Granted, she doesn't chew things apart, so I don't know if your dog is prone to chewing toys apart how that would play out.But I can't believe it looks as good as it does after months and months of playing!!I am SO happy I bought this toy -- as it is more ""interactive"" than most and she loves it!!!

Fisher-Price Little People Animal Sounds Farm,"I purchased this farm for my son who is just under a year old. He loved to play with the one at his grandma's house (an older version purchased at a garage sale a few years back) so I thought I would buy one for our house, too. When I took it out of the box, the silo section was not connected. I connected it without too much trouble but then opened the farm and the silo fell off. It continues to fall off all of the time! I have given up trying to keep the pieces together - it is a waste of my time. The farm animals now share stalls in the barn -making it a bit harder to make the animal sounds. It appears that the toy has been ""remodeled"" to be less expensive to make. The plastic is thinner, the quality poorer, and the spaces/stalls for the animals smaller and more complicated.

St.Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse (select size),"I'm naturally very pale, and it's been hard getting tan, sun or no sun. I used to tan in tanning beds and outdoors, I loved the color I got but was very worried about sun cancer and aging skin. So I started experimenting with many different sunless tanners, prices ranging from $5 to $60. I was disappointed with most, either they left me looking very orange or yellow and/or very streaky. I finally decided to order the St. Tropez bronzing mousse after hearing great things about it. It really does live up to the hype in my opinion; it dries quickly, gives instant color, and after showering it off the next day it looks very natural. The color didn't turn out as deep as I expected, but it was still a nice golden color and I'm sure with a second application the day after it would turn out even darker, which I have yet to try. The scent is nice, I still get the sunless tan smell the next day but it isn't as bad as some other brands I've tried. It does stain palms, so I use cheap latex gloves to apply the tanner, then use a tiny bit on the tops of my hands.The price is somewhat high, but honestly if the bronzing mousse was $100 I would still buy it so I think it's completely worth every penny. It lasts me a while if I use it 1-2 times a week. I hope they never stop making this product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting natural color.",beauty,bath body,scrubs body treatments,"('beauty', 'bath body', 'scrubs body treatments')"

When asked what type of feedback they have been getting as far as taste goes, they always reply ""good.""

Swede-O Trim Lok Ankle Brace,"It was true-to-size and 'fit'. The sewing and materials are very good, BUT!!!...It does not hold the ankle at a 90deg angle. The 'stiffening' isn't stiff at all, and not only offers ZERO support, but leaves a bulky u-shape that puts pressure on the soft tissue around the ankle. The material is bulky and does not fit into shoes easily or comfortably. It has no stretch around the calf so it bites into the hamstring & achilles tendon. The lacing is difficult to use at best, it has to be completely un-laced and re-laced every time the brace is removed/put on. Also, the lacing is angled such-that it does not tighten at the 'bend' in the front of the ankle, so it does not hold the ankle steady forward/back either. Since this brace offered no side-side or forward-back support, didn't fit in my shoes, and was actually painfully tight around the calf, (in other words, it dosen't do anything the description says it'll do) I returned it.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'braces')"

Cascade Canister Filter Pumps for Fresh & Saltwater Aquariums - UL Listed,"I'm new to aquariums but after doing my research I chose to go with the Cascade 1500.

The best part of it all is that I asked the local aquarium store owner what the best unit for my tank was (after I had already ordered this one) and he was trying to sell me this one.

"Tetra Whisper Power Filter 30, 30-Gallon","This is a simple inexpensive filter that works pretty well for aquariums. The design is pretty simple, the pump sucks up water which passes through activated carbon to remove toxic chemicals and then past a sponge to filter out suspended particles. More serious aquarium enthusiasts will probably want to add more filtration power to their tank but this filter does a pretty good basic job.Setup is real simple, just put everything together per the instructions and then hang over the side and plug in. I have found this power filter to be pretty quiet. I've installed this in two tanks. In one tank the water level is low and the splashing water covers the pump noise so I don't hear any pump noise. In the other tank, the water level is high, there is no water splash but the filter is hidden by the cabinet so I don't hear anything either. So either way, I'm pleased with the quietness of both filters.Most filter companies sell a basic power filter with the same basic design and I suppose all will work the same. Right now this filter is at a really good price so go for it!",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters,"('pet supplies', 'fish aquatic pets', 'pumps filters')"

Dior Homme Cologne by Christian Dior for men Colognes,"It's close to a perfectly crafted fragrance. This scent is built around lavender, iris, and cocoa. The opening drives some people nuts. It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick. Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray. I rather like the smell, but I can see how it would not appeal to everyone. After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own. The iris is pushed to the sideline, though it is still noticeable. Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender. While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender. But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa. This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent. It's not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience. Dior Homme projects well throughout its 6-7 hour lifespan.

Not only that, but other hair products make my head itch. When I say itch, I mean itch! I about can't stand my own head it will itch so bad. Even hair products designed to stop itch do not work on my scalp! As a last effort before I went crazy I had bought a set of Organix- the Moroccan Argan Oil. Since this review is just for the conditioner, I'll stick with my thoughts on it.Paired with the shampoo, it really makes such a difference in my hair and scalp! This set has almost completely stopped my itching. Not only that, but my hair is not as oily and it feels very, very soft. This is coming from someone who dyes their hair religiously. I love that when my hair moves, no lie, it almost looks like a TV ad. My hair is so soft, so shiny, and healthy looking.The conditioner isn't a 'to die for' smell, it smells good and that's what counts. It is a product that you have to use a little bit more than you would with other conditioners. Otherwise I feel it doesn't cover my head well enough and I have chin length hair. What you have to remember is that you have to wait 3 to 5 minutes before you wash this conditioner off. When I rinse, my hair is very soft, even when wet.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product. I do have to say this is the best hair product I have ever used and I love it very, very, very much.",beauty,hair care,conditioners,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'conditioners')"
Fat Cat Kitty Hoots Big Mama's Scratchy Box Double Wide Purple,"Like other reviewers, I was skeptical about a piece of cardboard, but I ordered this based on the reviews. I have two cats who completely ignore traditional cat scratchers in favor of furniture and carpets, no matter how much catnip I use as a distraction. However, for some reason, they LOVE this thing.I bought one 6 months ago. My girl only scratched it, but the boy also took to sleeping on it. Out of the blue recently, the girl is now sleeping on it and they are fighting for possession of it as I write, so now I'm back to buy another. I don't think I've ever refilled the catnip in the 6 months and they still go crazy for it. It's a little worse for the wear after all this time, but that doesn't seem to bother my fatties. It's the best ten bucks I've spent on them.The size is good too -- my cats are certainly double-wide themselves so they can fit (albeit barely) on it for a nap.",pet supplies,cats,beds furniture,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'beds furniture')"

Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray,"I was so excited to receive this Inis perfume, which I bought exclusively based on the rave reviews I saw here.Unfortunately, it isn't for me.

The citrus note gets stronger the longer you have it on, too.I agree that the scent is androgenous, could definitely work for either a man or a woman. If anything, it's maybe more on the man side, but just a tad.Scent is a very individual thing, so reviews aren't the most reliable in this category.

"Sanyo 1,000 mAh AAA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries 4-Pack","These uniquely support the very high discharge rate needed to fully power my Fenix LD01 flashlight on high.As good as the eneloop AAAs are, and they are better for resisting self-discharge for low discharge rate applications like remote controls, mice, etc, they won't support the high discharge rate that kills them in under an hour when producing 80 Lumens in an LED flashlight. Instead, the current is restricted down to nearly the MED setting.These 1000 mAh batteries will provide full power, and they'll almost double the run-time duration of many bicycle lights. They do self-discharge though, at least more so than the eneloop cells, so if you use something rarely, go with the eneloops.I carry these as my installed batteries, with 2 more carried as spares, and one eneloop cell to make 3.

Tube,"So, I had abused my heels with wearing flip flops, going barefoot around the house and we used to have Berber carpeting, so I think the constant scratching of the abrasive Berber didn't do my feet any favors. I had tried everything. I also hate wearing socks and shoes and don't want to wear socks at night either. I had dry heels and cracks were appearing everywhere on both feet. I tried a pumice stone and typical lotions, without any results. I was concerned enough to not want to have it continue, otherwise I'd need an appointment with a podiatrist.I had read that urea was helpful for dry, rough heels and this product contains urea, amongst others. I used this product morning after my shower after drying my feet well. Then at night, hit or miss, before bedtime as well. It took about 3 weeks of use, but now my heels look fantastic and healthy. All the dryness is gone! The cracks are almost all totally healed as well.I used the Mr Pumice (purple bar) gently under running water with gentle cleanser, then dried my feet well and applied the Dr. Scholls to my heels. Voila!I'll never be without this product again. Give it time.

"World's Best 00098 Cat Litter, Clumping Formula","So... World's Best Cat Litter probably doesn't live up to the brand name. I liked the fact that it was corn and ""natural"" so the dust that is inhaled by me and the cats isn't full of chemicals. However, my cats' first reaction to this litter was the same as other reviewers - a temptation to eat it. One cat kept trying to chew thru the bag to get to it. Initially, the same cat wouldn't even cover his eliminations - because he didn't like the feel against his feet? It's hard to know. In any case, I did mix the finer Cat's Pride (which seems to be the first choice for the cats) with World's Best and it seems to be doing an adequate job. I don't know what I continue to torture my boys through various cat litters when they are happiest with Cat's Pride but I am still trying to find a ""healthier"" solution. So, I tried Dr. Elsey's Precious and wrote a review of that and that's definitely off the list and I'm not sold on World's Best so I will try SwheatScoop next. I've heard lots of good things about it but will probably always mix it with Cat's Pride. Cat's Pride seems to make my cats the happiest - they like the texture and it has great odor absorbing qualities - and I am reluctant to let them have it because it contains sodium bentonite. In any case, I wouldn't give World's Best 5 stars - I'll go 4 because it clumps well, doesn't seem to smell but the cats don't love it.",pet supplies,cats,food,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'food')"

Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We order this, the original diaper champ, because we were told by almost everyone that the original is great but the new, ""deluxe"" is awful. So, we put this, the original, on our registry. The company that fulfilled the order is called Babyhaven. They sent us the deluxe, which is not what we ordered. We sent them a screenshot proving to them that what we ordered on our registry was the original, so they agreed to refund the person who purchased it for us the money, but said that we have to pay shipping. That seemed ridiculous, since it is their fault for advertising that they're selling the original but sending out the crappy deluxe. We eventually worked it out with Amazon, getting some Amazon credits in exchange for having to pay shipping to BabyHaven, but only after some phone calls and big hassle.

Vitamin C Crystals Ascorbic Acid 100% Pure Powder,"Hello friends!! I am writing a review which I rarely do even though I buy on Amazon quite a bit. Currently I am on day 29 0f 40 Day Water Fast!! This is by far the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life!!! The reason I say that is because of the long list of detox symptoms that come along with it, the worst one being absolutely NO ENERGY to do even the simplest tasks. I have done Vitamin C Flushes in the past and decided that this would be a great time to incorporate it into my water detox fast. It worked out perfectly! During the fast I have done a total of 11 days of Vitamin C flushes and have seen MASS amounts of built up mucus and toxins just pour out of my Lymphatic system!!! So often society is guided into thinking that ""changing your diet and exercise"" will net you a healthier life. While that may be ""half"" true, we forget that when we lived a TOXIC LIFESTYLE, that all of the toxins that we have ingested are permanently lodged inside of our tissues. We have to flush these out by some sort of means and it is by my personal experience that I believe that long water fasts and vitamin c flushes are the only way. The first couple of flushes netted me thick pasty like mucus out of the rectum. As I continued the flushes, I noticed less and less mucus that resembled more of a ""shrapnel"" consistency. This product definitely works if you are in the market for purchasing it for the purpose of Vitamin C Flushes. I should have bought a smaller jar as I do not see myself needing the product for the remanding duration of the fast. I would have given it five stars but the only thing I didn't like about it is the unpredictability of passing a mucus flush after it is ingested which can last for up to two days, but all Ascorbic Acid does that.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

NOW Foods Tea Tree Oil,"Despite the aroma of tea tree oil, which some people simply cannot tolerate, the health benefits of tea tree oil are well documented and they are many. This popular oil works against fungus, bacteria, and viruses. It is known to effectively fight a number of infections that are resistant to some antibiotics and is used by eczema and psoriasis sufferers.It is also used literally for hundreds of bacterial and fungal skin ailments such as acne, abscess, oily skin, blisters, sun burns, athlete's foot, warts, herpes, insect bites, rashes, dandruff and other minor wounds and irritations. The anti-viral properties of the oil fight many common infectious diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and measles, flu, cold sores and verrucae while improving the body's immune system.It is no wonder that tea tree oil, despite it's strong unfamiliar odor, is considered an essential oil.My experience with Now Foods Tea Tree Oil (16 ounce) is good. The oil is a high quality and works just as well as the medicinal quality 1 ounce bottles purchased from stores like Walgreens but the savings buying it in a 16 ounce quantity from Now Foods is obvious.

The ingredients statement, however, isn't forthcoming. As best I can figure, you're getting in each tablet 500mg (1/2 gram) of vitamin C, and 2 grams of sugar. Since it doesn't say what kind of sugar, we must presume it's white, refined sugar. There may be as much as 530mg of Vit C in each tablet, but apparently only about 30mg of that is from natural sources.

San Juan,"This game can be really fun. It is not as easy to get into as Dominion because a player needs to be fairly familar with all the cards in the deck so that appropriate stategies and decisions can be made.Play can vary greatly depending on how many people are playing. If 2 people are playing then the Library is a must build if you get it. And then if you get a Quarry... gg. On the other hand, if you can get Library, Smithy, Guild Hall then that is gg. If neither player gets either of those combos then you can have some fun games. With 3 to 4 players, the Library becomes less effective.For the price, I think this is a good game if you like playing games like Dominion, etc. The set up time is about 2 minutes and a 2-player game can be over in about 15-20mins which is a great advantage over games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid if you are short on time.The level of strategy versus luck in this game is definitely tilted in the favor of luck (unlike the above mentioned games). This can be frustrating at times if you are a big strategist but also allows those that are more casual gamers to feel superior to the hardcore gamer that gets some bad draws.All in all, this is a good game with a 3-4 game learning curve (to really know all the cards) but that can be done in less than one hour.",toys games,games,card games,"('toys games', 'games', 'card games')"
Ascorbic Acid Powder - 2.2 lbs - Powder,"I read on the Internet somewhere that ascorbic acid controls the iron stains in swimming pools, so I thought I'd try it. I used the entire package in one treatment and nothing happened. If you have a swimming pool then you know how irritating and expensive it is to constantly treat the horrible brown stains that appear on the underwater surfaces. The only effective thing I have found is a combination of Iron Out and Iron Myte. The trouble is, if you then fail to replace the water, or at least half of it, with iron-free water, the stains come right back within 24 hours. Although effective, each treatment with those products was costing me $30 each time, essentially every other day, until I was able to obtain iron-free water to drain and refill the pool. By the way, Iron Myte is much cheaper at Menards compared to Am......on. About 1/2 the price regularily. Also, I know that Iron Out is not recommended for swimming pools because it's an irritant. So use it sparingly , like inside a white athletic sock like an eraser, and don't use the pool for several hours.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

My last shipment was different in several ways. The flakes were thicker, tough and stuck in my teeth, and there was a gritty feel which gave me kind of a sore tongue. I contacted the cereal company online and they promised to make it right. Said the cereal had not changed its formula but during the period in question, there was a glitch and the flakes were rolled thinner. Didn't seem that to me, just the opposite, plus the taste was altered for the worse. They have sent me coupons to buy Nature's Path products, but no one around my small town carries it. I will use them, however, when I get to a larger city, 50 miles away. I then ordered the same cereal ""with raisins"" described as plump and juicy raisins, from a different on-line distributor.

Erector Motorized Racing Car & More - 643 pc Metal Construction Set,"We purchased this set for our son's birthday and were all very excited about building a model after supper.

Upon opening the box and the instruction manual, I was vey frustrated to see that it only contained instructions for ELEVEN models. The box clearly shows twenty-five. I was frustrated and my son was disappointed, but we selected another model and had a great time. The Erector Set website FAQs note that they do not include instructions for all models because they want kids to use their imagination. I think that is great, but engineering requires a basic set of skills before one can put one's imagination to work creating something greater. Overall, this is a fun toy, but my son was not blessed with a mechanical engineer for a father.

Nature's Way Super Fisol Fish Oil,"I have been taking this product for nearly a week and I couldn't be happier. Let's be honest, fish oil is one of those supplements that you have to have faith in because the benefits aren't going to be seen simply by taking it for a while. The main reason I like it is because there is no belching, no after-taste, no digestive issues or upset stomach, and these are the things I was concerned about from my experience with other brands. I had my shoulder operated on several years ago and I can sometimes hear the joint when I rotate it, or even feel it. Since I began taking this supplement, the joint seems to work much smoother.

Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,"I love my Moby Wrap. I got one with my middle son (now 4) and used it with my youngest and am now excited to get a new one with our soon-to-be-born baby. I am 5 foot nothing and I have NO problem using it. Yes, there is extra fabric but I like that it wraps around my waist an extra time. I love that it gives me a bit of tummy coverage especially in the first month after birth. I live in Las Vegas and have used the Moby in the summer without either of us overheating. When my boys got a bit older (6-9 months), I loved using the Hip position. Much easier than just holding them on your hip. I admit that I have yet to test the 35lb limit of the wrap as my boys started walking before they were that big. I can see that it is a bit cumbersome to put on in public. I have found that the way the Moby wraps around you almost looks like a shirt and if I am at a restaurant or somewhere sitting down, I can take the baby out but keep the wrap on. Then I can just put my baby back in the wrap when I need to, no need to re-wrap. I don't usually wear it in a situation where I am taking it on and off again. And I have gotten very good at wrapping it and can do it quite quickly. All-in-all, I can see where most of the complaints come from but they are not an issue for me. I love mine and am excited to use one again. Also I get so many compliments when I'm using it!",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers,"('baby products', 'gear', 'backpacks carriers')"
Boss Pet - Prestige 100ft Skyline Trolly,"I've had the Boss Pet - Prestige 100ft Skyline Trolly for a few months now.

The pulley wheel is plastic which has worn almost completely through to the point where it just drags instead of roles. All the metal clamps are rusted and one of the switches is broken. The line itself is pretty much intact and the screw hooks have held up nicely. Plan to replace all other parts though.

Chicco Toys 4 In 1 Ride On,"Both our boys absolutely love this toy. It has had use for four years and is in great shape. The side bars and rocking console come off and you can attach a parent bar that comes with it for guided strolls with foot rests or with out. So it is extremely versatile.When our boys were little babies learning to sit, it was a nice rocker, and a fun spot for the baby to watch the older child play. They love the music and noises and zoom all over the house in it at least once a day. Both the 2 year old and the four year old love this.We got the electronics wet, and ordered a new electronics console. I think it is great that this piece can be easily (and inexpensively) replaced.If you could only buy one ride on toy this would be a good choice. It is durable and multifunctional, and will grow with you r child. It rocks, it can be used to push off on and strengthen the legs, and it has a nice smooth and quick ride to it.

Almased Almased Multi Protein Powder,"I have been trying to find a good protein/meal shake that doesn't have a lot of artificial ingredients. The ingredients in Almased are basic which is what I like. The texture is a little coarser than other shakes I have tried, but this one keeps me satisfied much longer without making my blood sugar go through the roof. In my opinion I think the trade off is fair. I do dress it up a little though. I either add stevia and a table spoon of regular unsweetened cocoa powder, or sugar free hazelnut espresso syrup with a table spoon of dark unsweetened cocoa powder. Without any dressing up, the taste and texture remind me of a cross between muffin batter and cake batter. There are no artificial flavors but it has a creamy flavor, probably from the honey. I prefer to mix it with ice in the blender. If you make it with coffee and chocolate for a mocha flavor the coffee has to be at least room temperature or colder to avoid killing the probiotics. There are a few other recipes I want to try as well, just haven't gotten around to it yet.I haven't used it long term for weight loss, but have used it to recover from overdone splurges or when I'm just looking for a very light meal. If I splurge and put on a couple pounds I can usually recover and lose them again after doing my shakes for a couple days.Pros:Basic ingredientsLow glycemic impactSatisfying and stays with youGreat for getting in extra protein or for managing weightCons:The texture is a little coarser than most other shakes, but that is because it is minimally processed (in comparison to other mixes)The price is a bit high but this seller is lower than what I can get it locally forShipping was fast and arrived just as promised.

Niacinamide 250 mg 250 Caps by Swanson Premium,"When buying vitamin and minerals supplements on Amazon, I try to always buy Swanson because it's been a good brand for me so far. I bought this niacinamide because I had developed a sensitivity to niacine and it gave me what they call ""flushing"". I don't think that is nearly a powerful enough word for what happens. The first time it happened, I was ready to go to the emergency room. The second time was worse, but I figured out what it was and thought that I could get through one more round without ER treatment; and I did. It feels like your blood veins are on fire and it goes all over your body and then you itch. It lasts quite a while. For me, the second time, it was about an hour for the fire/itch part in full force, then another hour of getting better gradually.

Medi-Dyne Pro Stretch,"I had been experiencing pulled achilles tendons from running, which was causing pretty bad heel pain. I was looking for relief in any form and came across this stretching system on Amazon with good reviews. I have been using this for only a few days and have already felt relief in my achilles tendon's just from using this to stretch them a couple times throughout the day. It provides a better stretch than using a wall or staircase to stretch. All you do is position your foot in it while near a wall, using the wall to balance yourself and letting your other leg just dangle. You rock backward and you will immediately feel a stretching feeling from the back of your heel all the way up to the top of your calf muscle. You hold that for about 30 seconds than you can switch to the other foot or do again if you feel the need to stretch more. I didn't even realize how tight my calf muscles were until I used this and I will continue to use this in the future to prevent injury and prior to running.The only other recommendation and note I have is that you definitely want to have a sneaker or some sort of foot protection on when using this and not just go barefoot or with a sock. The surface and heel cup are very hard and it doesnt feel great on your foot if you don't have a shoe on, hence the 4 stars rather than 5.

Otherwise the sick fleas jump off and infest your house if they live - most likely they are already infesting your house. This spray should be used if you see one or two fleas and are doing the regular flea maintenance (drops, etc) on your pet. Fleas are very resistant to everything and very bad in the fall. This helped rid them, just make sure you use lightly as it is a strong pesticide.This ONLY last a few days, so you may want to reapply lightly once a week in the worst of the flea season.Note, you pet may be sleepy after application if he licks it a lot.",pet supplies,dogs,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'health supplies')"

The one I purchased here was just a little yellower than the original one I had but did not think anything of it as mine was a little over a month old. Immediately with the first try, I knew this product was not the same. I have been using this compact for over 6 years and have NEVER had an issue with it until I bought it here. No matter how hard I tried to get the powder on the sponge, it would not absorb onto the sponge the same way. Eventually, these hard, dark bumpy areas formed on the powder so I avoided that area of the compact because it would not budge on to the sponge at all. I did a half and half face comparison with my leftover MAC and the this one and all my blemishes and dark spots were still visible on the ""fake MAC"" side. The original side, flawless and perfect. I was really disappointed but should have known better when trying to score a deal. Maybe I got an old expired one, I don't know. I threw it out after my experiment from disgust. Needless to say, I will never be purchasing MAC products discounted online.",beauty,makeup,face,"('beauty', 'makeup', 'face')"
Sunbeam/Oster 1500 watt wall mounted hair dryer.,I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.,beauty,hair care,styling tools,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'styling tools')"

The Lavendar flavor my husband and my self put in our bath water. It's wonderful. My sister uses the Baby flavor on all her kids. Two have sensitive skin and two do not.

The Tea tree oil is still the best hands down. It's a bit pricey. But, I figure if it works with my problem areas, It's priceless. My Dad uses the Peppermint to wash his hair. He loves the tinglyness but Knowing his hair is clean is the best feeling. You can actually use the tea tree oil (Orange) for washing your hair, shaving, cleaning you face, put in your bath water for the enticing aroma and cleanliness, I could go on and on.

Unit blocks are highly recommended by early childhood educators, because they actually help improve children's learning processes.

The price is really high for a finished parawood (rubber tree) product, which is a relatively inexpensive wood. Being that these are parawood, which is one of the world's densest woods, the blocks are very heavy. In one way, it is good because they stay put.

It definitely isn't orangy - it makes my skin look more dirty than tan. Also, it smells like a musty basement. I didn't find any unpleasant odors with other self-tanners. This smell is very bad and I thought maybe my bottle of Fake Bake was old or spoiled. But it has not expired.I also found Fake Bake washed off. It didn't seem to last but a day or two. I exfoliated, moisturized knees, elbows, etc. and used the gloves (which ripped quickly), but did not get a lasting tan. It was a thick cream and I had to work hard to not get any streaks or to put it on evenly.Maybe Fake Bake reacts differently on everyone's skin.

I love that it wheels easily, reclines, has various height adjustments and doesn't take up too much space. I was initially disappointed to discover that the second cover wasn't included, as so many other pp raved about. I contacted graco and they said the add'tl cover isn't included with the Rittenhouse fabric, but she would happily mail me one. Very pleased with graco's CS! Some reviews said it was a pain to clean. I can't really comment on this yet, but plan to toss the cover in the wash once a week, let it air dry and alternate covers. It doesn't seem like it'll be too complicated to swap out. One small irritation is that the fabric is described as ""leatherette"" and I was expecting more of a vinyl feel. But it's definitely more cloth sort of like outdoor fabric which I think will be tougher to wipe down, which is probably where some of the cleaning complaints are coming from...Overall, very happy with this high chair purchase!",baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,"('baby products', 'feeding', 'highchairs booster seats')"

I especially like the fact that I can reuse them multiple times after a wee wee or poo (no, I don't leave the poo on the pad - it gets flushed down the toilet). In my opinion, having a spot or two of wee wee on the pads helps remind my stubborn Jack exactly where she is supposed to do her business! I keep two of these pads out for her during the day while I am at work and uses one pad for wee's and another pad for poo's. My only recommendation would be to consider ordering a smaller size if you want to replace the pads after each use and don't want to have used pads on the floor for a couple of days in a row. In addition, I found it helpful to use these in conjunction with pad holders as my dog had the tendency to get them all bunched up on the floor which made them not nearly as useful.",pet supplies,dogs,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'litter housebreaking')"

Wahl Heat Therapy Complete Heated Massage at Home,"So this thing is heavenly, I've recommended it to all my friends, and I've been using it for many months with no complaints... it does get a bit loud after the adhesive padding wears out btw the head and the metal casing, but you can easily unscrew it, put a rubber band in there, and it's quiet as a mouse again... a relatively loud mouse, but whatever.Anyway ok, so if you put this thing on the back of someone's neck, they will immediately transform into a gelatin monster. no jokes, it works. most vibrating massager things just don't vibrate with enough badassery to really work, this thing has the power to make your wrists pleasingly numb, or your shoulder blades paralyzingly happy.Speaking of rubber bands, you can attatch rubber bands to the head, and then secure the massager to parts of your body, for a hands free awesomeness that leaves you free to type on a computer or yodel... with hand gestures. I find that, as with all massagers of any type, it feels bestest when you aren't actively holding it, something about having to direct the energy yourself makes it less satisfying... so rubber-band the thing onto your back like a backpack, or onto your calf or whereaver, and it feels so much better... hands free yo, hands free.Also having something secured to the head makes it way quieter.Buy 7 of them and give them out as gifts. do it.",health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'massage relaxation')"

Hand down best turtle filter I have ever owned. There is not one speck of algae, food, or poop on the floor. Totally worth the money. This has made owning a turtle the easiest task on the planet.

Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,"We bought this stroller as our kids are 21 months apart and our eldest wasn't always up for walking. Now, they are 17 months and 3yrs old and approximately 60lbs combined. Sometimes our eldest doesn't want to walk but pushing that kind of weight is impossible. The wheels aren't responsive and coupled with the weight of the stroller (~35lbs) it is quite a load to push around parks/playgrounds/cities. The manufacturer suggests up to 45lbs but that is not very long depending on the age and size of your kids. Ours are both tall for their age but normal weight.It was great when we had a newborn but the infant seat does push back the backrest so that if your other child is sitting, they may bump their head on it. It's not ideal but for us, it did the trick until now. I do sometimes think two bucket seats would be better as the child in the back can't really relax but on the flip side, they can easily jump on and off which ours does constantly.",baby products,strollers,tandem,"('baby products', 'strollers', 'tandem')"

I feel bad that she's uncomfortable and worry that she's going to scratch herself, so I've been looking for alternatives. Now I remember why I gave up on these harnesses with my other dogs. They don't fit every dog, and even when they do fit, they chafe under the arms unless your dog has a really thick coat. My pittie mix immediately tried to rub this off her and I could see why - the buckles were pressing right into her armpits no matter how I adjusted the straps.It's going back without even a walk. It looks less comfortable and more harmful than the GL.

It turned my dark honey blonde hair COPPER orange with orange juice-colored highlights & left my hair brittle & dry. I was convinced that my hair was going to fall out. I couldn't believe the color. I fixed my hair (sort of) after several processes of stripping it & re-coloring it over the past 3 months. I also had to chop off 3 inches because of this dye & how it left my hair. I ended up ""fixing"" it by stripping it with Kenra lightener & then re-coloring with a few John Frieda foams. I'm still not out of the woods. I'll have to keep cutting my hair as it grows out because it's been damaged so badly by this dye. It will be years before my hair is back to an acceptable state. I hate this dye!!! Never again!Thankfully, the John Frieda dye has restored some of the texture back into my hair & returned it to a healthier condition. My hair felt better even after bleaching than after this dye.

The first time I washed it I found it slides easily off the frame and though I was expecting to feeland see a difference in the canvas after a washing, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could not even tell it hadbeen through the wash!- The size is spot on. This hamper easily holds a weeks worth of laundry for my two active, messy little boys. But it isnot so big that it gets in the way or looks gaudy.- It carries easily. Even though the hook moves around, when you pick it up by the hook, the hook slides intothe locked position and the frame remains stable and it is not awkward or hard to carry around.Cons- If you are hanging the hook on a bar or rail there is the possibility that it can slide up and down.FYI",health personal care,household supplies,laundry,"('health personal care', 'household supplies', 'laundry')"

I do NOT snap the top onto the bottom of the litter box with the tabs as I like easy access to the box. Much easier to pop off the top, scoop and then return the top to the litter box without latching the side tabs. The top sits fine on the bottom without the snap latches and do not fall off when a cat enters or exits the box. This litter box works well with kittens and with adults up to about 15 pounds.

They still stink like hell, but they effectively remove all unwanted hair, and leave skin smooth and soft for about 2 weeks. They come with a sponge to smooth the cream on. I leave it on for the shortest duration noted in the instructions, and then rinse off with a gentle Buff Puff Sponge thoroughly in the shower. Hope this helps some of you. If you're skin is highly sensitive, you may want to avoid the Buff Puff method, or avoid cream depilatories completely. I just know it used to be too harsh for me and did not work, and now the results are much different.Aveeno Contact Form is at:[... ](People wonder why I kinda HORDE products that I like....This is why.)",beauty,skin care,body,"('beauty', 'skin care', 'body')"
Potty Mouth,"Yes my dogs eat poo. The only benefit to this is seeing the various faces of the people who like to let dogs lick their faces when I tell them that they appreciate a far less sophisticated meal than kibble.Seeing as how one of the pups has never met an ear that she did not want to cover in her saliva, it tends to be a bit icky when her breath smells like what I just stepped into in the yard with my new white nikes.The pills work. I found that if I was missing days with them, they would go out and get themselves a little pooptacular treat. One of my pups also became a bit ill at the same time as I was giving him these pills. He has not been sick in a while, so I believe it to be stomach distress coming from every single ornamental plant I had planted in my yard that he decided tasted better than the extremely expensive premium dog food I feed him. Though why I complain about his taste in food when he obviously craves the one thing which makes dogs kind of gross.",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'training behavior aids')"

Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,"This is the first time I have written a review for a product on Amazon, but I just had to this time. We have a wonderful dog we adopted two years ago, but he started barking a few months ago, and it was driving us crazy. Any noise in our yard, the doorbell or knock on the door would send him into a barking jag. He would usually stop when we yelled at him, but it was all the time. When I put the collar on him I was worried that it would bug him, but it didn't seem to bother him in the least. The first time he went out to bark at something in the yard he got out one bark and that was it, quiet. I thought maybe this would change, but no, the barking has all but stopped.

Baby K'tan Baby Carrier,"I'm on baby #2 and bought this sling the very day she was born. I must say I love this product and use it multiple times a day. As a mother of an active 2 year old, I have to always have my hands free. I also have the Moby Wrap and Baby Bjorn from my first, but so far, I prefer the Baby Ktan.Pros:1) SO easy to put on. Put it around your neck while holding baby. With one arm holding baby, slip one arm through a loop, move the baby to that arm, slip the opposite arm in the other loop. The Ktan NEVER touches the ground and your baby is always in your arms to avert the hold-me-cries which is the reason you need the sling in the first place. The Moby wrap is SO cumbersome to put on, it's not worth it to take out of the house. You definitely need two hands to tie the darn thing in place and the vast length of material inevitably touches the ground, which can be gross if you are at a restaurant or public place. Baby Bjorn is easier to put on than the Moby, but still more difficult than the Ktan. Since there are buckles, usually someone else has to be holding baby to put on.2) Relatively easy to get baby in. This takes some practice. The Ktan and Moby are similar in this regard, but I don't use the extra midsection piece for security since I'm not doing major lifting. I find that if you spread the fabric of each loop out to cover the baby twice, the extra midsection piece is not necessary. Right now my daughter is only 7 weeks old and I pretty much use the Ktan to get her off to sleep or go for walks. If I ever attempt to do more strenuous activity (housecleaning, tackle football), then I'll definitely consider taking the time to place the extra piece.3) Easy to get baby out without waking her. Since I don't use the midsection piece, I simply peel each loop off her back and butt, lean over the crib, and slide her onto the bed. I find that the lifting motion required to get baby out of the Baby Bjorn usually wakes them up.4) Easy to wear when not in use. I don't find the sling particularly fashionable, but if you are in a situation requiring baby to go in and out frequently, it's nice that it is lightweight and stays out of your way so you can drive and walk with ease. I've never left the Baby Bjorn on sans baby, but I imagine its stiffness does not lend to convenient driving.5) Easy to pack. The Moby is huge and difficult to pack, as is the Baby Bjorn. I can throw my Baby Ktan in my diaper bag or purse and have room for other items.6) Saves me the hassle of getting a double stroller - so far. I just pop my toddler in his single stroller like I normally would, throw the little one in the sling and get going. I know this is short-lived while she is still so tiny.Cons:1) The small ring that holds the loops together serves to tighten the wrap once baby is in place. This can be difficult to reach if too high up. Putting on the sling so this ring is within reach takes a little practice, unless you are a body contortionist.2) One size does not fit all. I'm 5'3"" and 140lb (hopefully 15 pounds lighter in the near future!) and wear the size small. My husband is 6'3"" and probably would not be able to fit the sling. This does not pose a problem for us as he would ""never be caught dead wearing a baby in a sling."" But definitely a consideration if your husband would.3) Price. At $10 more than the Moby Wrap, I had to seriously consider whether buying this sling was necessary when I already had the Moby. It's just a few pieces of fabric! Why so expensive? But since I figured I would never have the time to tie the Moby wrap while chasing around my 2 year old, it was worth the money.4) Nursing baby in sling is difficult for me. So far, I haven't had much luck using this to nurse. Maybe it's because I'm on #2 and have much fewer qualms about just whipping it out in public.So after 7 weeks, I'm still loving this product better than the Moby and Bjorn. We'll see if it stands the test of time.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers,"('baby products', 'gear', 'backpacks carriers')"

The primary issue is that the clock hands are incorrectly lined up with the numerals on the face, and it doesn't seem to be something that can be adjusted. The result is that it's pretty tough to tell which hour is actually the correct hour (is it 5:30 or 6:30??). It's not usually a real problem, as we are generally aware of what hour we're within, and the minutes don't have to be that precise (it's not like we're running a railroad; it's a baby's room!). Cosmetically, the clock is okay from a few feet away, but upon close examination there is glue smeared across the face in a couple of places which was kind of irritating.

People stop me when I'm out to comment on his hair and ask what I put in it.I'm black and I keep my hair in an afro. I use the conditioner, too.

Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,"My experience with the product (used on 3 dogs of various breeds and personalities) was a mixed success. Without question it discourages pulling on the leash, and definitely made walks much easier in all 3 cases. Controlling a dog is definitely easier with the Gentle Leader, and it is very easy to slip on once you get the hang of it.We worked with a very good trainer for 2 of the 3 dogs, and each dog was desensitized to the Gentle Leader by trainer.However there were issues with all 3 dogs -1) Each dog commonly will stop its walk and try to ""paw"" the gentle leader off of its nose. This happens on average once per walk, and no amount of correction seems to stop future ""protests."" Indeed I do not believe the dogs enjoy wearing them.2) The piece which attaches to the leash hangs down so that a dog can chew on it. I have one lab mix which becomes aggressive when he sees another dog or cat while on a walk (and yes we are working on this issue). The lab mix turns his aggression on the Gentle Leader and chews on it HARD. We had a close call recently where he literally chewed all the way through the connection while we were walking him. Luckily I caught on quicker than he did, and was able to attach the leash conventionally to his collar before he bolted after a neighbor's cat.3) Our smallest dog is a 16 lb Chiweenie. He seems to shut down with the Gentle Leader and is more likely to cease walking altogether when wearing it, than he would be otherwise.At this point, we feel like the Gentle Leader helped us with our dogs' walks but also may have provoked some unwanted aggression and protest.

Not that it's a bad thing, just not the refreshing ""lime"" smell I was hoping for.The soap was okay, ok slip, ok lather... but didn't ring my bell. Paid it forward to a friend who liked it a bit more than I did, but also wasn't blown away.Maybe I just got a bad bar?

Wahl 5537-500 Performer Battery Operated Beard and Mustache Trimmer,"OK look, I don't use this to trim my facial hair. Actually I don't plan on using this unit anywhere near my face. I use this to trim the hair down in my danger zone. I haven't found a product that effectively removes the hair in this area so I have been using a variety of beard trimmers over the years. These products won't get the area perfectly smooth but you just have to follow up with a safety razor and you will be good.I decided to buy this product based on price, design, and the Wahl brand.Here are the pros and cons of this product:Pros:1. Powerful motor mows down the short hairs with ease2. The design looks good and it feels good in your hand3. Price4. Comes with some accessories should you decide to use this on your face5. Battery operated as opposed to plug and chargeCons:1. EXTREMELY NOISY - If you are in the shower with this thing, people will know what you are doing in there. It is much noisier than the last few models I have used.2. Looks kinda cheap to me but then again most of them at this price point do.3. Very easy to clip some sensitive skin down in that area if you are not careful as the blade moves very fast. I nicked myself twice and drew blood. ...Not painful but annoying.4. I don't think it's waterproof so be careful if you plan on rinsing it. I just do a quick rinse to the tip and clean it with alcohol.For what I use it for, I think it's good for the price and does the job very well. I'm sure if it can cut the hair down there, it must be good for the hair on your face.As long as you can handle the noise, I recommend this unit.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,"('health personal care', 'personal care', 'shaving hair removal')"

She wasn't ready yet, but absolutely loved playing with the detachable toy panel part and still does. Her favorite part is the little door that opens and says peekaboo! Now that she is 10 months we tried again walking and she is getting the hang out with but is still pretty wobbly and can't steer but she has so much fun that she gets mad when it's time to stop. We have to help guide her and control how fast it goes and now she wants to walk all the time! Check out her face in my picture, it is priceless.

Euphoria Cologne by Calvin Klein for men Colognes,"This CK cologne is very attractive, yet it is not without problems. It has an unusual fragrance for men of lavander, roses, and cinnamon - without it being not unquestionably manly. And this was an anchievement of sorts, as a flowery fragrance is typically associated with women. There exist two downsides, however. The first is that it does not hold very well, and the second plays off the first. It is slightly cloying. So I believe CK needs to refine this cologne - and Euphoria Intense is not the answer. Yet even still, this is an intriguing cologne, if not excellent, and meant for sporty/informal events, school wear, or a night's out, rather than for formal wear or the office.",beauty,fragrance,men s,"('beauty', 'fragrance', 'men s')"

New Life Spectrum Thera A Formula Non-medicated Anti-Parasitic - 150 g,"I never write reviews but I am so happy with this product I had too. I was very skeptical even after reading the great reviews but decided to make one more 'last hope' food purchase for my sickly Blue Ram. While all the other fish in the tank were thriving, he was very thin and progressively had gotten worse over the last few months, showing no interest in any food I bought. I tried to find the old 'Parasite Guard' food as a last effort to save my fish. I stumbled over this and thought I'd give it a shot. He showed little interest for a couple of days but then began to nibble it. I have only been using this for a few weeks and my fish looks and feels 100% better. He devours this food! His colors are coming out and he doesn't have that thin appearance now. He is gaining weight and becoming feisty. The other fish love this food as well, even the algae eater looks for every crumb hours after feeding time. Will definitely order again, but will be a while as you don't have to use much.

It seems similar to leave-in conditioner yet it's a bit thicker than that. Overall, however, it's thin and slides through your fingers compared to other products like pomades and the heavier American Crew products, sort of like a hand lotion. It doesn't work as well for me if my hair isn't a little wet. So I just wet my hands, run them through my hair, lather up my hands with this stuff, and run that through my hair, and then press down the hair on the sides of my head and toss and flip in around the parts near the top and front--and it looks great and continues to throughout the day.

This classic game that reminds me of late 60's music such as the Beach Boys, the Mamas & Papas, and Paul Revere & the Raiders is really a total blast to play with other people. I tried playing Twister alone one time and I felt like I was defeating the purpose because nobody was standing to the side to watch me hurt myself and stumble around with neverending silent facial giggles. I always feel like somebody's watching me! Truly not one of the more appropriate and proud moments of my life right there, haha. I'm referring to the embarrassment of playing alone to my old Black Sabbath albums. I'm not proud of that at all. I could care less how ridiculous my twisty, turny, awkward body movements are to the always-ready-to-humilate eyeballs watching over me!Anyway, Twister is a game for the entire family. It's sort of like an exercise routine when you really get into it. Maybe even yoga? Nah, not yoga. Entertaining in one square-shaped area on the floor that's safe and well... no, it's not really safe at all. I mean it is safe unless, like I say above, you really get into it. In that case be careful not to fall all over the place and bang your knees on the hard living room floorboards which can bruise with age and cause walking discomfort. When you walk funny you don't want people to know you were twisting the night away the night before. I do wonder if people have actual memories of playing Twister.

Everlasting Treat Ball,"I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats. My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure. But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right ""not-too-fast, not-too-slow"" rate. Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours. The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it. This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable. My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear. I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats. I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work. A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treatswww.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1",pet supplies,dogs,treats,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'treats')"

"Just for Men Brush-In Color Gel for Mustache, Beard & Sideburns, Sandy Blond, 1 color gel, (Pack of 3)","I have used Sandy Blond on my head hair for ~ 5 years. At first I used the hair coloring but it was messy and I wasted a whole bottle just trying to fix sideburns and hair at the temple. Also, if you only have graying in a few spots, the hair coloring will make the rest of your hair darker which really doesn't fix anything and makes it noticable. I found that the beard coloring works perfect on head hair also and it is much easier to target only the areas you need to fix. You can also get multiple applications out of a kit. Just make sure to squeeze all the air out of the tubes before putting the caps on or it can degrade.Now, 5 years later, that my gray extends over the ears also, I still use the beard coloring. Once you brush it on, it works best if you take the brush and pull some of the coloring out onto the head to blend it together. If you experiment with the time left in hair by starting at 5 minutes and working up in 1/2 minute increments, you will eventually find where the color is correct. That combined with the blending will make this product work very well. BTW- 5 minutes doesn't hardly change the hair but for me but 6 - 7 minutes works. You should use a stop watch to get consistent results.",beauty,hair care,hair color,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'hair color')"

The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),"I've tried many different cat toys over the years.There is a distinct difference in the quality of play between this particular toy (with the carefully arranged feather ""bird""), and every other ""fishing pole"" design toy I've tried. The design of the ""bird"" causes it to spin (snap swivel attachment to the string) when moved through the air quickly. This creates a sound that is irresistible to cats. Combine this with the length of the pole, and you have what I believe is the most effective toy out there when it comes to getting those kitties moving.So if you've been underwhelmed by a ""stick and string"" type cat toy--this one is still very much worth a try.",pet supplies,cats,toys,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'toys')"

"NuGo All-Natural Nutrition Bar, Orange Smoothie, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)","Ever since I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver( a very painful condition where the liver is so filled with fat that it stops functioning right and can not process sugars, fats, and carbs correctly. So when you eat it causes a horrid cramping pain under your right ribs) I stopped eatting...anything. Which is pretty bad too. Then I started trying different bars and found that many cause my Fatty liver to hurt bad until I ran onto these. Many of the bars are based in chocolate which is not my go to food even before I was diagnosed. So I am always looking for tasty bars OTHER then chocolate.The Orange Smoothie Nugo bar and the Vannilla Yogurt Nugo bars fit that bill well. The round rice things are softer and smaller then most bars which is better for me. They have a light sweet flavor that is very tasty and not alot of sugar substitutes/fat(which a low functioning liver can NOT process well).

The bottom of the jar has some minor scrapes too. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe its a really old product and maybe it was upside down and maybe the letters came off with the box itself while transporting it or keeping it in storage....nah!!!

Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,"A friend convinced me to watch the show and I became hooked. Like a lot of others, the 10th doctor is my favorite and I really wanted a sonic screwdriver of my own, so when I saw this one I just couldn't pass it up.The toy is plastic, but despite that is an almost exact replica of the one used in the show. It is sturdy for the most part. The sound and light is great.I only have two small complaints. The first is that the pen nubs very easily come off. I put it in my pocket or my bag, and next time I go to pull it out, the pen part has come off. The same goes for the switch that extends the top part out. It is made to take off so you can reach the screw underneath in order to take it apart and put the batters in, it just snaps on and off, but I find it comes off pretty easily.Secondly is that it is plastic. For the price, I feel that at least the silver parts should have been metal. One of the iconic sounds aside from the buzzing that comes with the light is the little metal clinks every time the doctor extends it or flips it or stows it back in his pocket, and so I tend to find the plastic kind of lacking. Unfortunately, metal replicas are extremely expensive.Now, if the price were a bit less, $10 or $15 instead of over $20 then the plastic wouldn't bother me so much. Not counting that, it is still an excellent toy, well made, and looks great. (Though I think it might be a bit bigger than the one in the show). I don't regret buying it, and would recommend it to any fans of the show. But if you're a collector and really want an impressive replica, I'd consider some of the more expensive ones (not found on amazon unfortunately.)",toys games,action toy figures,accessories,"('toys games', 'action toy figures', 'accessories')"

Cali in mid-August). In preparation of the transfer to their new home, I taped the transport tube to my car's AC vent as I drove the 85 miles to work. I got to my rented room, poked 4 holes into the gel (along side the container's walls) and dumped the ants in. REMOVE THE TAPE FROM THE 2 TINY HOLES ON THE COVER CAP TO MINIMIZE CONDENSATION OF THE HABITAT. They busily engineered interconnecting tunnels. About 2 weeks in, I felt the ants were crowded with the excess ""gel-dirt"" from the tunnel making (from the gel surface to the roof was gel crumbs). So when I saw that the majority of the colony was chilling in the bottom-most chamber one afternoon, I popped the whole habitat into the fridge for 10 minutes, then dumped the excess gel (and about 5 of the ants) into the toilet and double flushed.",toys games,learning education,habitats,"('toys games', 'learning education', 'habitats')"

Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,"I was surprised by the flimsiness of this product. It's solidly constructed from genuine cheap plastic parts (excluding the necessary metal for the battery pack) After opening the package the slide button immediately popped off. This is supposed to come loose to allow access to the screw that opens the battery case. However it is always loose and ready to pop off. Lifting my thumb off the button is often enough to pull it loose.The 'two distinct sounds' are barely discernible from each other even in a completely silent room. Press button once for sound one and again for a minutely different sound.The little UV light works perfectly.My sonic arrived with one working pen nib (the ink pen) and one dry pen nib (the UV pen) I can only assume this toy has been sitting in a warm place for a very long time because the UV pen nib was sealed in factory shrink wrap but was still bone dry when it arrived.The suggested 'fix' for this is either add water to the nib. (we all know how well that works) or buy a new one. (oh, I see)The batteries are easily installed but you will need a very small screwdriver to do so. (an actual screwdriver) Which is kind of funny when you think about it.This toy is cute, it's fun to have, but I wouldn't purchase this for anyone under the age of 13.

Giselle Perfume by Carla Fracci for women Personal Fragrances,I bought this perfume from nordstrom a couple years ago and loved it!!!

Kong Zoom Groom For Cats,"This is OK, but my cat prefers the 2-sided brush I got at Target - black plastic bristles/metal pinhead bristles. She has long hair, and the massage idea doesn't work well for her - messes up her hair. She's also sensitve on her body, so she doesn't like to be massaged with the fairly hard rubbery teeth, and she loves gentle brushing with the black bristles on the sides of her face - she loves it so much that she jumps up into the brushing...The bristles don't feel sticky to me (some reviewer said they attract the hair to it), and I don't find it easier to clean than the first brush I got; nor does it work as well in removing loose hair. Regarding cleaning, I prefer the Safari self-cleaning slicker brush which cleans itself beautifully with the press of a button - all the hair comes off in one neat rectangle; it also removes more loose hair, and I like the color of green Safari brush and the gripper handle. I have to be extra carefulwith that brush thoughbecause the bristles are so thin and stiff that it could easily scratch the cat.",pet supplies,cats,grooming,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'grooming')"

"Vitol 100% Egg Protein, 12 oz (340 g)","I've tried a bunch of different egg protein powders which I use daily in a blender shake. I have used a lot of this Vitol product, the NOW product and the Optimum Nutrition product. All are roughly comparable in price, with the vanilla Now being 8% more at this time and the Optimum Nutrition chocolate costing 42% more (using the best deals on Amazon now).Optimum Nutrition one of the best tasting and easiest mixing. It also has a nice fluffy consistency that blends easily without caking up on the sides of the blender like some brands. It has some ingredients some may object to- artificial flavors and sweeteners. It has the best looking jar.Between the pure protein NOW powder and the vanilla Vitol, the Vitol is a bit less expensive in the 40oz size but more appealing, better tasting, and mixes up a little better. The Vitol is flavored and sweetened naturally with stevia.I use 100% egg powder because it is cholesterol free, amino-acid balanced and milk-free. Balanced vegan protein powders can be expensive and soy or pea products can be hard to digest; soy also has negative nutritional factors and female hormone analogs. Milk-based powders can have lactose or allergens for some people.So for me egg protein powder is a great way to get protein that is easy to digest, allergen free, inexpensive and low calorie (free of fats and carbs).NOW Foods Eggwhite Protein, 1.2 PoundOptimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'nutrition bars drinks')"

Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long. In my case their useful life was only two months while being used every one or two days.-The plungers lock when depressed all the way, which makes extracting something difficult because you have to pop it loose.

I will have to update this review at a later date once I've tried the machine with gel (I've only used lather), but it seems to work fairly well. Is the lather going to burn your skin coming out? Definitely not. But it's not cold either. It works and is decently heated. I also think the lather comes out less messy than previous (and more expensive) machines I've owned. It has automatic turnoff if you forget to hit the off button. It is a little tricky attaching the bottle to the cap of the machine, but once you correctly get it on, it works well.There is one drawback- you can't shake the can of shaving cream easily while it is in the machine. Thus, your lather comes out someone wet, rather than creamy.

"KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Red","When I first got my lab/aussie puppy, he would eat so fast that he'd make himself ill. The trainer suggested that I stuff his food into a Kong and make him work for it. 14 months later, he no longer scarfs his food, but he still loves his Kong. I've read tons of blogs, and the Kong site itself, on how to stuff a Kong and what to stuff it with. I find variety is the best, so while I use the same base ingredients, I toss in something special each time. I currently have 4 Kongs that I rotate between the dog, the dishwasher, and the freezer. I plug the hole in the bottom with a baby carrot, layer in kibble, unsweetened applesauce, shredded meat or canned food, plain Greek yogurt, chopped veggies or fruit, peanut butter or almond butter, broken treats-- whatever I have on hand, then into the freezer it goes. I try to make the first layer he gets something motivating, like applesauce or peanut butter, and the bottom layer something easy, like kibble. The deepest layer is hardest to get to, and the hardest to clean, so I want to be sure he can get it out. (If you decide to stuff your Kong this way, a good quality bottle brush is a must) My dog will spend at least an hour working on emptying the Kong.

He loves to just play with the tree and we have ferocious tug of war matches. After over a week so far so good...except one of the squirrels split at the head but that was my fault for playing tug of war with it & him. The tree is a lot more durable for that. As always I'd recommend supervision with this toy because I'm not sure how long it would really last if he had some time to try and destroy it.

"Fluidmaster 8302 Flush Sparkle Bleach Replacement Cartridge, 2 Pack",I bought three of the chlorine clean and sparkle units (not be confused with the blue die units). All work well and we are pleased with the cleaning they do. I did need to modify the fill tube attachment on each one. On the 50 year old Eljer toilets there is no center fill tube. The fill tube is molded into the back of the tank. I made a mistake I made years ago. I left the tube full length and it slowly siphoned the water out acting just like a leak. After spending a couple of frustrating days and various replacements for the flush system I realized that there was no leak but rather a siphon. I even remembered that all this happened once before. I cut the tube length so that it was above the water level. Everything has worked fine since. On the one new toilet the fill tube on the Fuidmaster dual flush replacement I installed did not allow for the supplied attachment system to connect to the shouldered tube. It was easy enough to buy a brass tube and solder on a modified brass bar from the discarded flush handle thereby making an idea attachment system. My only concern is that the cast iron hub sewer pipe will eventually be negatively affected by the continual exposure to the strong oxidizing of the chlorine treatment.,health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning,"('health personal care', 'household supplies', 'household cleaning')"

"Nature Made SAM-e 400mg Double Strength, 12 Enteric Coated Tablets","This stuff works wonders!I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I lost 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my best friend/roommate to cancer all within 2 years.My doctor placed me on Welbutrin but that stuff made me completely insane! 1 day I was angry, 1 day I was completely miserable, 1 day I was unbearably tired. I also had a horrible headache when I was taking it. I felt like was a mindless zombie on Welbutrin. I decided to stop taking the Welbutrin before it settled into my system.I figured I would try and go the more natural route after reading all the side effects of the other anti-depressant medications they have available. I first triedKira St Johns Wort Tablets - 45 Tablets. These seemed to help, but it was very mild and not consistent in keeping my mood up.Then...there was Nature Made Sam-E. I tried some of the store brand Sam-E's to try and keep costs down, however, none of the other brands even came close to working as good as Nature's Made. And if you shop around you can usually find a buy one get one free at Walgreens, Giant, CVS, or even Amazon!This stuff helped me through the roughest time of my life. I've been using Sam-e well over 2 years now and if I even missed one dose I would immediately notice a huge change in my mood. I have been taking 1 400mg pill a day since I started. Once in a while I would take took 2 or 3 in a day.I just started taking 1 pill every other day to give my body a break because I do not like to be dependent on any type of medication. But for those super hard times, this stuff really helped to get me through.I highly recommend trying Sam-E. Especially before trying any prescription anti-depressants. It is a natural approach to overcoming depression, has low to no side effects at all (I never experienced any), and even if it does not help with improving your mental health, at least it is supporting your joints. ;)Hope this helps!",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

(maybe the cat walked past him, or maybe someone in another room got out of a chair) Putting the collar on him did not bother him at all. Everything was normal (to him) until he just decided (of course, again)to bark for no apparent reason. He stopped immediately. Walked around like ""what the heck"" then tried to bark again. He stopped immediately again. This time we said ""no Bark!"" to help associate that phrase w/ being quiet. He has been quiet ever since.

Met-Rx Big 100 Meal Replacement Bars 12 ea,"They don't taste too bad because they have loads of sugar but you will never mistaken these for candy bars. They still have that weird protein shake taste and I could only taste a hint of cookie dough flavor. Also the bar is very chewy so it will take you some time to consume the whole thing.I suppose in an emergency situation you could get away with these but I find it easier just to eat real food. I would find a can of tuna, water, and a piece of fruit more enjoyable than chewing away at this and other meal replacement bars. This particular bar is a meal replacement bar and not just a protein bar but I think there are so many other ways to put together a 400 calorie meal that tastes much better than this product.At least this bar has real sugar. Some bars that advertise only 2 or 3 grams of sugar are loaded with sugar alcohols or some other chemicals that are not good for you. Then again, I don't know how 25 grams of sugar is supposed to help you reach any weight-loss or nutrition goals.The pictures on all of these meal replacement products look appetizing but in reality the product itself is anything but.My advice is to find a way to just get your protein from real food.

D-Mannose,"I am only 22 years old and my marriage was failing because of recurrent UTIs. Let's just say... every time...I would get one. They would last for anywhere between 3 days and 10 days.I took over-the-counter pills (AZO, Cystex) and all they did was provide temporary relief. Eventually they stopped being effective altogether since I had to use them about 2 weeks in a row at a time.I got a prescription for Macrobid, an antibiotic. It did work after about a day in clearing up a UTI, but did not prevent them. Plus who would want to be on antibiotics their entire romantic lifetime? Not healthy at all. Expensive too.I ordered this after finding a forum post about it. I didn't believe it would work, I really didn't.... IT DOES. IT WORKS. My marriage is currently long-distance while my husband's immigration from USA to Canada is processing, so I had about a week to start taking one heaping tablespoon a day in a bottle of water. Usually I took it at night, not in the morning (so I'd never forget to if I was in a hurry one morning). My husband arrived to visit me... NO UTIs. NONE.There was one day I did not get to take the powder, and I felt a tiny, tiny little tinge of one coming on (so I took a Macrobid pill as a precaution, even though I probably didn't need to). But the next day I took the powder and never felt discomfort again. So for me, it's 100% proven. THIS WORKS. If you take it daily, you will not have UTIs again.I would also avoid alcohol/fizzy drinks to be honest, anything rough on the bladder. I DID however drink lots of coffee and it didn't affect the powder's usefulness. Still worked!!!I will take this powder every single day for the rest of my life now!!! COMPLETELY WORTH THE MONEY!I am totally appalled that doctors refuse to suggest this little miracle. I'm very young, and it SAVED MY LIFE.

Fisher-Price Smart Cycle,"We've had this for a little over a year now (my son received this as a gift shortly before his 4th birthday), and my son still uses it.Pros:It's held up to the abuse of a 3-5 year old boy who is very energetic and active. He carries it from one place to another, climbs all over it, etc.Batteries seem to last a long time. It runs on D batteries, rather than AC. I have rechargeable D batteries, and I've only had to recharge them a few times. He doesn't play with it every day, but he does play with it a few times a week, sometimes for an hour or two at a time. Alternatively, you can get AA to D battery adapters (I have ones from Focalprice - super cheap, but work marvelously. They convert 2 AA batteries to a D - search ""2AA to D Battery Adapter Converts 2 pieces of AA battery to D battery"" on focalprice dot com). 2 AA batteries are equivalent to 1/2 D, so the batteries will run out faster, but rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and easy to get a hold of, unlike rechargeable D batteries, which are expensive.My son enjoys playing it. It's easy for him to use the controls and do what he wants to do. As he happens to like the ""racing"" games best, he ends up pedaling a lot, though the pedals have very little resistance, and the resistance is not adjustable, so I'm not sure how much exercise he's really getting even when he's pedaling a lot.The seat is adjustable, so it works for kids of various sizes.The games aren't particularly obnoxious.It comes with a very long cord to connect to the TV.It's very easy to set up and use - nothing complicated about it.The cons:It runs on D batteries with no AC option. Yes, if you know what you are doing, you can wire it to run on AC, but most people don't know how to do that. I get that it's nice to not have that extra cord, but you already have a really long cord going to the TV anyway, so why not have the option to run on batteries or AC?The games are pretty much all the same with different characters. We have the game that comes with it, Scooby Doo, Superfriends, and Cars. They look different, but they're all the same game.I don't know how it is with the newer version of this bike, but the games we have with our bike all have graphics that look straight out of the 80s. Cartridges are probably going to hold up better than whatever alternative there could be while still allowing for small kids to handle the media, but would it have really added much to the price of the bike or the cartridges to have the graphics meet Nintendo 64 levels? The bike is already the price of a cheap console, and the games are ridiculously expensive, so I assume the margins are pretty sweet for Fisher Price.There's no memory or saving of anything. You can't take a screen shot and send it anywhere. My son doesn't seem to care or notice, but it would be nice if there was some way to save preferences or save files to a memory card.Overall, none of the cons outweigh the simple fact that my son enjoys this toy, and it has some educational value, and it's not obnoxious.",toys games,dolls accessories,dolls,"('toys games', 'dolls accessories', 'dolls')"

Skunk-Off Shampoo - 8 oz,"If you can only afford one, I would buy the Shampoo. Of course my dog is not dry yet but I can put my nose into her coat and smell nothing. I used the spray as soon as she was sprayed but because the bulk of the smell/oil was around her eyes I was not able to spray the area. I let the spray dry and then threw her into the shower and started to wash her. I had to wash the affected area about 4 times to get all of the smell out but it is well worth it. Warning, one 8 oz bottle will wash a Golden Retriever until all of the smell is gone, once. You might want to buy multiple or the gallon jug to make sure that you have enough incase you could not get the affected area as well as you wanted.

Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,"I'm not normally the type of person to do a review, but I feel obligated to write one for this product. The gentle leader is a miracle worker. I have a sixty pound hyperactive Labrador Retriever (more than half my weight), and no matter how successful she is with training in the back yard, she would go nuts whenever we got into unfamiliar territory. I tried everything with her--clicker training, positive reinforcement, treats, a check cord, stopping when she would pull beyond the length of the leash, etc. Things would go great in the back yard, but once we got into the real world, it was a whole different story. With new sights, sounds, people, and dogs, Ella would lose all self control. It often led to me holding onto the leash with all my strength walking awkwardly behind my overly-excited dog.Finally at my wit's end, I caved in and decided to purchase the prong collar from a local pet store. When I spoke with the associate, he asked me why I had chosen to utilize the prong collar. I explained my efforts to him, and he redirected me to the Gentle Leader. He explained the differences between the two to me. While there is debate amongst pet owners on whether or not the prong collar is humane, this review is not intended to address that issue. The Gentle Leader is much like the headstall and reins for a horse. If you have control of the head, you will have control of the whole body. The body goes where the nose goes. Holding the two up next to each other, the Gentle Leader looks much less menacing than the prong collar. The associate urged me to purchase the Gentle Leader, and if it did not work, then I could try the prong collar.I went home, and I was excited to fit the new gadget to my dog. Word of advice--watch the DVD included with the kit prior to fitting it to your dog. It clarifies a lot of uncertainty in fitting the Gentle Leader. I tried to follow the instructions provided on the paper, and though I was successful, it would have been much less confusing if I had watched the DVD first. I initially had some trouble with the nose loop. I could not figure out how the collar and nose loop worked until I realized that the nose loop had to be pulled up through the double-D ring. It seems like when the collar is fitted properly, the dog has the possibility of choking because it is supposed to be such a tight fit to avoid chafing. However, the DVD explains why the dog will be fine with such a tightly fitted collar.I fitted Ella with both pieces, and there was initial hesitation on her part. We started our walk, and there was quite a bit of pawing at her face for the first five minutes. There were a couple of pulls ahead of me, but she quickly learned that she was not comfortable with her head being redirected when she lunged forward. After adapting to the feeling of the Gentle Leader, Ella became a completely different dog. She was being incredibly well-behaved walking at my side. She didn't pull once after the first five minutes, and we enjoyed a two-hour walk together.In short, the Gentle Leader is a miracle-worker for anyone with a dog who chooses to walk them rather than being walked. I was astonished at how easy it was to walk her, and I am looking forward to exploring new places with her. I used to be embarrassed that she would drag me along as she sought out different stimuli. Now, she is easy to walk with, and I enjoy my time with her. Walking Ella is no longer a chore for me. She gets the exercise she needs, and I get to keep my arm. The Gentle Leader is by far one of the best purchases I have made for my dog.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'collars')"

"Ozium Glycol-Ized Professional Air Sanitizer / Freshener Original Scent, 0.8 oz. aerosol (OZ-1)","This stuff is great! I bought a three year-old used car that only had one previous owner, and that owner was a smoker. The dealership tried to cover up the smell by spraying the car with that awful not-quite-new-car perfume which only made it worse. It had also picked up a slightly mildewy smell after a few days of being parked outside in the hot, humid Ohio air.I purchased a little canister of the original scent Ozium at Meijer (it's cheaper there, btw) just out of curiosity after reading the good reviews on Amazon. When I got home, I sprayed it a good deal more than the recommended 1-2 seconds (sprayed the back seat, trunk, front seats and foot wells, fabric lining the doors, the ceiling liner, etc) which was probably wasteful. I cracked the windows and left it alone overnight. At first, the car smelled almost overwhelmingly like Lemonheads candy. In the morning, there were no smells at all, Ozium or otherwise. The smoke and mildew smells are gone rather than covered up - there's none of that awful ""kind of smoky, kind of lemony, generally still gross"" odor.

Cadbury Curly Wurly Bar from England (Pack 6 Bars),"As so many have said here- hands down, I agree. Yes, these Cadbury Curly Wurly bars are reminiscent of the Marathon Bars which were sold here, in the US, at least over 30yrs ago (Wow. What a downer to be reminded I am that old! SMILE)! Very similarly great tasting! But, of course- with all due respect to Cadbury (the makers of the Curly Wurly bar) the Curly Wurly did come first but it IS a Marathon reminder! And, of course- that's coincidental since the Curly Wurly was a predecessor! (and, I can only guess that Cadbury is PRAYING that we stop with the Marathon thing- I know they are thinking, ""Marathon WHO?? WE CAME FIRST!"".However, yes, Curly Wurly's inevitably IS a pleasantly missed reminder of that old missed Marathon Bar! Which, by the way- should be good for Curly Wurly sales here in the US.

"Petmate Ultra Vari Kennel Fashion Pet Carrier, 26-Inch, For Pets 20-25 Pounds, Deer/Brown","We chose this crate since it resembled the one our puppy was kept in by the shelter we picked her up from. She does love it, and feels secure in it. It's a good compromise between airy and den like.We purchased it on our way home from the shelter, and a surprisingly number of pet store employees recommended against it. They suggested all metal containers, to make cleaning easier. An all metal cage doesn't strike me as a homey den. So we didn't go with all metal.Cleaning has not been a problem with this crate. It easy to just spray it with a garden hose; shake it a little; and leave it face down to drain and dry. It can be dissabled also, if necessary.My one complaint, and it's a huge complaint by others as well, is the cheep clips that secure the top to the base. Our puppy has used the crate for 7 months now, and one of the clips is about shot. All the clips are cheep and hard to secure, but this one in particular has been the clip she has chosen to chew. A failure by any one of the five clips, renders the crate useless.I'm online looking for a new carrier, and would like to find a carrier similar to this one, but the cheep snapping side clips are a deal killer, since they are intended to hold the crate together.

MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation - Choose Colors -,"All women, young and old, have tried many make up products in their lives, whether it was an inexpensive brand or a high- priced brand. They have most likely tried products that irritated their skin, felt too heavy and spent money on products that didn't give them any coverage at all. MAC studio fix powder is the solution to all those problems. It is a product that women of any age and any color can use; this product is a good price for the economic problems, ladies might have and covers all the imperfections that women are afraid to show. I can relate to this product because I use it on a daily basis.MAC studio fix powder is a powder and a foundation combined in one and is very easy to apply, rather than going through the hassle of applying liquid foundation and then later applying a matte powder, the studio fix powder is a one-step application. This is good for women of any age, whether you're eighteen or fifty this would be a great to use. For teenagers the powder does an amazing job covering any acne that may occur, as well as dark circles and uneven skin tones. For women, age fifty and up, all the wrinkles and dark spots are erased within a blink of an eye. MAC studio fix powder is made in thirty- two different shades so any one is able to use it.If you've been spending too much money on products that don't work, you'll love how the studio fix powder is within a reasonable budget and how much coverage you can get from applying it once a day. This product feels very light on the skin and looks very natural too. Many powders can make your face look cakey and oily, the studio fix powder is very different; it makes your skin look flawless just like a celebrity's make up would. Many celebrities use MAC's merchandise because they love how it feels on their skin and after a long day it still looks nice. We all know who Kim Kardashian is, she is one of the many celebrities that uses this product on a daily basis and she uses it for a lot of her photo shoots. Not only is this great for everyday use, it looks beautiful when wearing it to parties.Some may argue that this powder makes your face oily and it feels heavy on the skin, but many women love this product and they use it all the time. Some also say that it can't be applied every day, only on special occasions, but depending on how much you apply is the result you'll get. From what reviews say online, this product is very good at covering all imperfections and it doesn't feel as heavy as other products may feel on the skin.After searching for a long time for a good product, many women say that the MAC studio fix powder, is by far the best ""two- in- one"" product out there. Almost every women can relate to make up because they all use it, so why not use something that you will love from the start. This powder is very good at giving a women full coverage and doesn't clog any of your pores like other powders may do.

And if you don't like this smell, which is rather mild, there are about 20 other scents that on can choose from. Absolutely the best. Make sure that if you buy any of this brand of soap, to buy it from the company called Soap Hope.

Squigle Enamel Saver Toothpaste,"I've had problems with canker sores (aphthous ulcers) for years. Sodium lauryl sulfate is often accused of being the key culprit, but it's not been easy to find a toothpaste that doesn't use it. Until now, Zinc and B6 supplements have helped. But then, a few months ago, into my life came Squigle. And it works better than anything else I've ever tried.Now, if I eat spicy foods or anything with cinnamon in it or accidentally bite the inside of my mouth and a red bump comes up, it goes away before it has a chance to turn ulcerous. For me that makes Squigle, while a good bit more expensive per ounce than other toothpastes, well worth it (although I'm really ticked off with myself for ordering two tubes from this particular Amazon page when I could have bought a 2-pack from another Amazon page for three or four dollars less. Ah, well, I'll know better next time and I wish the same to you.)But wait, there's more!! According to its label, Squigle also contains 36% xylitol...a product of nature derived largely from birch wood and sometimes known as wood sugar. And xylitol is the key ingredient in the do-it-yourself mouth care system recommended by Ellie Phillips DDS in her new bookKiss Your Dentist Goodbye",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene,"('health personal care', 'personal care', 'oral hygiene')"
Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase. But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration. So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store. When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package. I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell. I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff. I was kind of disappointed. It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me. Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me. To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood. Very musky but weirdly comforting. I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me. I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature. For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours. For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers. For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit. There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"
PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,"This feeder is PERFECT. I have a miniature pinscher and she has to be fed at very exact times of the day. With this feeder, I get to make sure that I'm giving her the correct amount of food for her three meals a day AND I get to give her a Greenie to give her something to chew on in the middle of the day. I couldn't ask for more!I had been apprehensive about purchasing this feeder because of some of the reviews about difficulties in programming it. I didn't have a single problem. I'm starting to think that the people who had difficulty just chose to not read the instructions, which are VERY simple. The feeder WILL repeat your feeding schedule. You can program up to 12 feeding times. I only use four (three for food, one for the Greenie). I set the feeder up at 7:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 7:30 p.m. and it repeats that schedule every day. I had attempted to use the Bistro automatic feeder, and let me just say that that made me wary of using an automatic feeder ever again. It never could dispense the correct amount of food, even after I made some modifications to it. Now, that problem no longer exists. I know exactly how much food is being given to my dog and at what time.If you're looking for a simple feeder that is VERY reliable, then look no further. Seriously...there's almost no reason to be disappointed with this product if that's all you're needing.

Mix in some garlic and ginger and a good soy sauce like sempio 501s and you have a great flavor base or combination for any asian cooking application. Be aware the 36 ounce container is a net weight not a fluid ounce size. Hoisin sauce is heavy by natural weight of ingredients and if you use it frequently this size may not be as much as you think. There is approximately three 8 fluid ounce cups per 36 ounce bottle. I just used an entire bottle making a marinade and a dipping sauce at one shot. This sauce is very good tasting and fits the bill nicely. The price is not too expensive nor is it cheap, it is reasonable. The bottle is plastic and squeezable and much easier to deal with than those ubiquitous small overpriced supermarket glass jars. Since the sauce is so heavy and slow moving like heavy ketchup try upturning the bottle so the sauce sinks to the cap when it is upside down and you will get the last drop.

Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit Eyebrow Makeup,"I am not usually one to review anything, but this eyebrow kit is the best method I have tried to fill in my thinning brows. A few years back, an overzealous waxing job left the inner part of my eyebrows bald, and since then have never grown in; the rest of my brow is thinning as I age. This kit with its stencils is such an easy step in my makeup and having well defined brows makes me look younger and better. The powder is exactly the right texture, there are enough stencils that I am able to use the thin version of the stencil and still not look like I have drawn anything in. The powder doesn't smudge like some that I have tried, and it stays on all day. No one can tell that I have virtually no brows to speak of, they look so natural when I finish off by using a spooly afterwards. The irid brown is exactly the right colour for my hair and overall tone (I am brunette).

Angel By Thierry Mugler For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray Refill 3.4 Ounces,"Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said "" tester"" . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors. Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes.

Nutranail 5 to 7 Day Growth Aloe Formula .45 oz.,"Okay, first of all, I have rock hard nails that grow so fast I am always cutting them. I don't need harder nails. Unfortunately, one of my nails somehow got a fungus (I have no idea how, I wash my hangs about every 2-3 hours). I bought fungus nail stuff at the drug store and that stopped the fungus and prevented my nail from looking worse. Unfortunately, my nail had detached almost halfway down my nail bed and looked horrible. I got this product because I needed my nail to get healthy again and grow out so it would attach again. This helped a lot. My nail grew fast and stopped looking like it had pits in it. My nail had also thinned a lot which this stuff seemed to fix. I don't know how much was just my nail healing on it's own and how much was this product, but I would use it again. Apply it often though, keep the nutrients on your nail.

Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,"I'm not trying to hype this up, but this is honestly some of the best soap I have used.I use it for hair, facewash, and bodywash. If you plan on doing the same you have to keep a few things in mind. This stuff is rather concentrated, so don't use as much as normal. Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own. It took me a little getting used to but I am happy I made the switch. Also, I bought a 16 ounce for like 9 bucks and didnt have to get shampoo, body, or facewash again for about 3 months. Cost effective much?For hair, put a little in your palm and lather it up, then put it in your hair. scrub as usual. If your hair is especially dirty, rinse and do it again. Once I started using this product I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now. You might want to do the same and see how it goes. A lot of people think that it will get greasy and gross, and maybe yours will, I dont know. For me however, a day or two after washing with this soap is when my hair looks its best. Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage. Honestly it awesome, try it out.For face and body, just toss a bit on a washcloth or scrubber and lather it, then wash away.The peppermint feels great, and smells good too.

Miracle Coat No Fly Zone for Dogs 12 oz.,"For some reason flies have set up home base in my dog run even though I spray it down with cleaner and bleach regularly, wash my dog often and brush his coat, pick up his mess and wash away his urine daily.

So I wanted to give my poor pup some respite and got this to spray on him and his bedding (that is washed and changed daily) but I can spray this directly on a fly and they come right back and land on his bed. I soaked his bed with it right after a washing, still flies. I've sprayed my dog thoroughly and taken minutes to brush him thoroughly to make sure its on every strand of his fur, still flies come as soon as I stop brushing him.

"Conair Quick Gems Hair Jeweler, Purple","I was out shopping over the summer and happened to see this product on an endcap of the linen store (BB&B). It was priced on clearance for $4, but I quickly looked up online reviews for it, since I had never heard of this product before. I was pleasantly surprised to find the ""regular"" price of the product was significantly higher and that it had gotten great reviews. So I purchased it and hid it away for 2 months, awaiting my daughter's 7th birthday. Well, I just gave it to her and she loves it. She wanted them in her hair, even though it was almost bed time. Since I don't know how well these stay in overnight and the ""refills"" cost more than 4x what I paid for the unit, I told her we'd have to take them back out before going to bed. She wanted to try it out anyhow. I'm terrible with doing anything but brushing hair, but even being so inept, I was able to figure this tool out quickly. My daughter was able to almost do it herself, but did need a bit of help positioning her hair. That's fine, it's nice mother/daughter time. And I have no doubt that it won't be long before she gets it figured out on her own. I was nervous about how difficult it would be to remove the gems, but they came out very easily with reading the directions on the best way to remove them. It took maybe 5 minutes to fill up her hair with the pre-loaded gems (the unit has a few extras and I actually put those away to use as ""replacements"" for when we inevitably wind up losing some), and then when we were ready to remove the gems, it took maybe another 5 minutes. My daughter has some sensory issues and can't stand her hair being pulled, like when we have to remove a pony tail holder, but removal of the gems didn't pull on her hair at all. I would definitely recommend this product. And even at the price listed on amazon, I would consider purchasing it again to give out as birthday gifts.",beauty,hair care,styling tools,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'styling tools')"

Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We borrowed one of these from friends to use with our newborn and I hate it so much that I considered buying one just so that I could destroy it.The side does not drop down far enough to be useful for breastfeeding, and the bed attachment mechanism is wonky. Also, the fit and finish is terrible, and the fabric smells like plastic. My wife pinched a nerve in her hip doing the strange yoga move required to get the baby out of this thing without getting out of bed. Ultimately we moved it away from the bed so that she can simply stand up and pick the baby up, which turns out to be considerably easier and less painful.If you hired a team of mechanical engineers to design the world's worst folding mechanism, you could do no better than the team who conceived and produced this.

Does not hold her rear in the tub(though not designed to do so) as such she will put half her body out of the tub if I am not watching.Other Thoughts:1. These should make bath time much easier if you have a dog that does not like bath time. Make sure to position them on the bottom of the tub, they have a very strong suction, but if placed on the sides will slide upwards freeing your dog.",pet supplies,dogs,grooming,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'grooming')"

"SinuFix Mist - For fast, natural sinus relief - 0.5 oz","This year's allergies got so bad that my sinuses were completely stopped up - reverting to their closed, pre-surgical state. The few times I could breathe, I had severe runny nose. I tried all the OTC antihistamines, (resulting in weirdness, sleepiness or zilch). I tried all the ""natural"" sprays (xylitol, OLE, cayanne, and even horseradish!) Only the addictive, rebound-laden drug-store nasal sprays ""worked,"" but they make the problem even worse after a few days. (This is all on top of my reoccurring sinus infections that I resort to Olive Leaf Extract capsules for - usually after the fact).I reconsidered the homeopathic ideas that seemed to work long before, despite my subsequent skepticism. Between Sinufix, (and Sabadil for general Hay fever symptoms), my nose has done a complete 180! It has never been this good during allergy season - ever. Moreover, instead of 2-3 nasal rinses a day, I now feel NO need to rinse my sinuses. (I started with a neti pot, graduated to the ""hard stuff"" like power rinsers and huge syringes) And even when I would rinse, there was no improvement and nothing seemed to come out except water (and then the residual water inside would make breathing harder for hours afterward).Most amazingly, you actually CAN'T ""feel"" this stuff working! No stinging, no drying out, no weird sensations or smells. It's Fire and Forget.

"Midwest Puppy Playpen w/ 1/2"" Grid 48L x 48W x 30H","This is what you would consider to be a long-term review. I purchased my Midwest Puppy Playpen (48x48x30) over 35 years ago. I still have it and although finally showing some signs of age in the finish (it has been stored outside in a shed when not in use), it still functions as well as the day that I purchased it. It has been invaluable as it housed litters of puppies, new puppies to our home that needed housebreaking, kittens/cats that needed a safe place to acclimate themselves to a new household and pets that were ill and needed to be confined temporarily. I love the fact that the floor can be set at different levels, so that when puppies are small, they can be high up to allow them to be easily reached through the top, a real back saver! As they grow, the floor can be lowered and they can use the door. The pans underneath (mine are metal, I would actually prefer the plastic they now use) allow you to line them with paper or chuck sheets (the plastic lined sheets they use under patients in the hospital) to catch any waste so that you can even use it in carpeted areas without concern to your floor. This has been one of the best investments I ever made for the care of my pets and I would recommend it to anyone. Although somewhat pricey, it is one of the few items that I would say is truly worth every penny. One bit of advice, if you are going to use it for puppies, small dogs or cats, I would get the 1/2"" floor to accomodate small feet that might fall through the 1"" squares.",pet supplies,dogs,houses,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'houses')"

Nutrex Niox,"This product didn't live up to my expectations.Being from nutrex, i expected the best. And being from Amazon, I expected the correct product to be in the picture (as of now they show Volu Gro).I feel something of a NO pump after taking this. Stamina goes up, strength goes up a little, and veins become slightly larger (nowhere near the advertised pictures of NYC subway maps sticking out of someone's arm).That being said, get the original Jack3d while you can (being pulled from market soon). It is much more potent NO pump and has other effects making it by far the best pre-workout I have ever used. (Jack3d micro is not the same as Jack3d fyi).Also taking 12 pills a day kinda sucks. They arent big but they taste a bit foul and its just a lot of pills. (looks super incriminating to take in public)Overall, glad I tried it. I use it before college rugby games where jack3d is banned, but other than that not worth the money. Stock up on Jack3d.Note for the future.

I tried a few other brands that didn't contain aspartame includingGlee Gum Triple Berry, 18-Piece Boxes (Pack of 12)). Between was the best, primarily because the taste lasted and the gum doesn't harden after a few minutes of chewing. Granted, the flavor of this gum won't last as long as standard commercial gum found at the grocery store.

"Nature's Answer Passionflower Standardized, 60-Count","I have had a chaotic year and getting to sleep was difficult for me at times. I would sometimes take 3 or 4 Benadryl a night but after learning of Benadryl's anticholinergic properties, I decided to stop using it as my go to sleep aid. Since I'm at a serious university with a double major / double minor and preparing for graduate school, I cannot take chances on anything that could cause ""brain fog"" and felt really stupid having gone so long doing so.I read reviews on Passionflower and asked a holistic herbalist friend who works at a health food store about it. She said it was much better to use then OTC drugstore products. I bought it on Amazon and haven't looked back.It's really changed my life. I take two around 7pm to prepare for a 10pm sleep. It doesn't take long to start working. The hours leading to sleep are calm and focused. Usually I jet around or watch TV but with this, I find myself going a slower, even pace and preferring to read or chat with my friends. The effects I feel first are an overall calming and a peacefulness to my thoughts then my body. Almost an ethereal happiness that makes the idea of laying in bed and sleeping a soothing idea instead of a frustrating one.If I've had a ramped up kind of day, I'll sometimes add a Melatonin. Melatonin gives me headaches and nightmares though so I tend to avoid it.I have to be up at 4am for rowing practice on my school's team. If I would take Benadryl or Tylenol PM, getting out of bed for this was a nightmare and nearly impossible. With Passionflower, I wake up refreshed and alert, I am able to bounce right into practice and my day without feeling slow or tired.Also, I am dating someone whose mother had insomnia as well.

Gundam MSN-04 Sazabi MG 1/100 Scale,"I recently finished this model, is the oldest MG I have put together (I believe it was released on 2000), and it shows.The completed model is huge, bigger even than the EX-S gundam, so if you want a smaller and newer model I highly recommend the 1/144 HGUCThe inner frame is on the simpler side, without much detail. This is specially bad on the funnel racks, without any detail on the inner surface. There is some more detail on the lower legs, cockpit and backpack, but nothing too brilliant.The articulation is a mixed bag, with policaps for joints. There are ball joints in the shoulders and hips, but the mobility is limited, specially on the hips, you can't get more than 20 degrees of abduction. Extension and flexion is limited because of the front and back skirts. But the knees are the biggest offenders, with less than 45 degrees of flexion. The neck is on a double joint , with a wide degree of motion. The elbows are also double jointed.The armor plates also are on the lacking side of details, without much panel lines. Still, this leaves a good margin for you to get creative with your paint job.There are a few gimmicks, such as the cockpit, the articulated monoeye, pistons on elbows and ankles and the funnels, which are fully articulated.The proportions are a little odd, but still accurate to the lineart. This also means that we get a smallish decal sheet and dry transfers.On the good side, we have a sturdy model and a fantastic design, although a little stiff.Well, that's it. With a new RX-93 ver Ka on the horizon, there is not to unreasonable to think there will be a sazabi ver 2.0, so I would recommend you yo wait for it.",toys games,action toy figures,figures,"('toys games', 'action toy figures', 'figures')"

My hair feels nice and soft, not fried like it would with a bleach product.I had my stylist apply it and she was impressed that it worked nicely and was made with natural ingredients.

Terra Sweet Potato Chips,"I got a great deal on these but it was clearly too good to be true. The taste is terrific -- very zingy but I had a strong negative allergic reaction to something in the chips. And that's where the mystery begins. Either it's the presence of canola oil (probably GMO) or some undocumented MSG -- or both. I would hope by now that the large corporate organic food companies would find a healthier oil and leave out anything that could cause health problems. I also have celiac disease so it may be some kind of wheat variant not listed on the package. Clearly this product could be a real winner but it only made me hyperventilate (even overnight), needlessly so. Maybe Terra should take a look at Kettle's old black bean tortilla chip recipe (which was phenomenal and so healthy) and then develop something along those lines. I would buy that in a nanosecond.

I wasn't left with smooth results at all, even after doing it several days in a row. It really is painful, but you're ripping hair out, so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating. I just couldn't get this to work for me.

BbSounds Angelcare Movement Sensor w. Sound Monitor w. Two Parents' Units,"I thought it's time to write a review for this monitor. I got it with my first child three years ago. I now have my second child and love the peace of mind it brings us. Both of my boys were belly sleepers. This monitor would allow me to put them in their crib on their bellies without worrying about burying their faces. Yesterday morning the alarm went off. Before I got in the room the alarm turned off. I checked the baby (11 weeks old) and he was breathing and he his head was turned to the side so I could see he had plenty of air. The only thing I can think that happened was he stopped breathing long enough to trigger the alarm and the beeping was enough to startle him to start breathing again. This monitor is worth the price for any parent. Even when the baby wiggles his way up to the top of the crib, the monitor can still pick up his light breathing.I wouldn't plan on it being your only type of monitor. The parent units get too much static. We quickly stopped using those with my first child and only turn on the base when the baby is in his crib. Also, it doesn't work well if you have an incline in the crib. When our first child began to sleep in his crib we had him on an incline. The monitor couldn't pick up his light breathing with both the matress and his incline and would falsely go off.I also have a video monitor that i can view on my phone.

Safari Flea Comb with a Double Row of Teeth,I have large hands and this fit well in them. This comb really captures the fleas well. It is comfortable to use. What is nice is that it captures the fleas so quickly that you don't have to go over your pet several times over. It also does a good job removing flea eggs and waste. I would suggest you keep a moist towel next to you to clean the comb as it will get full easily. The only complaint I have is that matter that gets stuck between the two rows of teeth can be a little challenging to remove. A toothpick or something narrow like that works well to remove the matter. It really isn't that difficult to deal with. I love this comb it really does a efficient job.,pet supplies,dogs,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'health supplies')"

Remington NEDH-2500 Titanium Personal Trimmer for Men and Women (Nose & Ear Trimmer),"I purchased my Remington NEDH-2500 Titanium Personal Trimmer at Walgreen's and have used it for almost two years. I've had no problem with it trimming nose hair sufficiently, but it is a little difficult to cut those just inside the base of the nose without doing some simple contortionist feats. This is the only trimmer of this sort I've ever used. I only use it for trimming nose hair, so I can't compare it against other brands or rate it for any uses other than that purpose. I've never been nicked while using the trimmer and it works well with fresh or recharged batteries. It uses a single AA cell battery. The trimmer has a single switch that slides on/off with only one speed. It's easy to clean, just remove and rinse off the cutter head under hot running water and you're done. The package includes the trimmer, ear hair cutter head and a clear cutter cap. This is a nice and inexpensive trimmer.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,"('health personal care', 'personal care', 'shaving hair removal')"

Still, I feared getting burned, as previous lotions in the 35 or 50 range had failed, either due to my incompetence or my complexion.This one worked. I applied it twice, once before initial exposure and then, after getting wet, another time for the return portion of the river trip and the intense mid-day sun and extended water contact. However, it stung my eyes considerably the first application, as I never seem to get the knack of it avoiding my eyelashes.It is creamy and smooth.

Tiny Love Super Deluxe Lights and Music Gymini Activity Gym,"I purchased this item five and a half years ago for my first baby. She absolutely loved all the activities.

The mirror is a little warped but a great activity for babies. My daughter absolutely loved the elephant. She even played with the toy, pulling the string constantly, well beyond the baby years. My son loves looking at all the contrasting images on the mat and enjoys the little sounds he makes pushing down on the squishy parts of the mat. The openings to attach the toys are perfectly spaced for different levels of eye-hand coordination. The gym is well made and even after washings, the mat holds up. The lights after five and a half years, still work. I would recommend this as a baby shower gift if the mom does not have it in her registry.

Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,"I was pleased with this product when I first opened the package. It is made of a relatively thick quilted material to protect the seat, and I do like the plastic tubes that fit between the seat back and bottom to keep the cover in place. It actually worked very well for the first week or so. However there are some issues. The elastic straps on the bottom of the cover probably work great on elevated seats, but for nearly 100% of cars since the 1990's that have rear seats that are molded down into the car these straps don't work. The metal hooks that come with the other straps help to keep the cover anchored, but since nothing keeps those hooks attached to the cover, they get lost or misplaced immediately.The straps that hold the top of the cover to the headrests worked great at first, but after a week one of the very cheap, thin, and flimsy plastic buckles snapped from the weight of my dog as he was trying to maintain balance with the cover sliding on the leather seats under his feet. So now the cover looks terrible, sags on one side, and no longer protects the seat which is the entire purpose. I suppose it works if you want to buy a new one every other month, but then you might as well get a more expensive cover in the first place.2 stars because all this product needs is stronger straps at the top and a more clever seat anchoring system at the bottom. And from what I've read, it used to be that way before this company switched to cheaper components to save money.",pet supplies,dogs,carriers travel products,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'carriers travel products')"
PURELL Hand Sanitizer 1000ML NXT Dispenser KIT with TWO ALOE or Original 1000 ML BIB Refill Cartridges,"I have had my two Purcell dispensers for 3 months now and I LOVE them. I ordered two and each dispenser came with two refills. They arrived as promised. And in perfect condition. I have one in the kitchen and one in the guest bathroom. With two refills still left over for replacement. They were very easy to install. They have a sticky tape backing and a screw wall mount section on back. I used both. I peeled the tape back, placed on the wall then used screws to secure to the wall. Both may not have been necessary but I figured I wasn't going to move it later so might as well secure it now. The refill bags were very easy to put in. Just feed the nozzle through the opening on the inside of the machine like instructed and adjust bag inside square to close lid and your done. To help my kids to remember to use them I give out reward tickets if I ""smell"" that someone has used it without being reminded. Seems to be working like a charm. And using the name brand like this does work better than generic. Some generics really dry out the hands. Not these. These devices are pretty big and they are brownish in color like you see at offices or restrooms so not very attractive but to stay more germ free I will suffer with the eye sore. They are also not automatic so you do have to compress button with the palm of your hand to use. I opted for these instead of automatic because there were a lot of complaints of the automatics wasting batteries and going off all the time with just mere motion NEAR the machine.

He still pulls, not always as bad but it doesnt stop him when he has his mind set on something. As far as putting it on him-- RRIIIGHHT---- What a joke! If you can manage to Not get your dog to move for 2 minutes, maybe, but good luck with that! Its a pain in the### to get on him. I honestly stopped using it because its so frustrating trying to get it on his neck. You cant just slide it on or off your dog, you have to mess with it and twist and turn it until it snaps on or off. I could see it working if you have a tiny dog, but on anything bigger-- good luck!

I've been growing at a slow, steady pace in the recent past, though I notice I always seem to have some residual soreness. Drinking two shakes a day of this whey protein has virtually eliminated that. I feel I can go full blast at whatever activity I'm doing without worrying how it'll affect me for the following few days. Whatever it is about this whey protein, it's getting into my body in a meaningful way.You probably want to know about the taste. It's kind of bland, like you might expect from a plain vanilla whey protein powder. Nothing gross or offensive to the senses. Then again all I do is mix it with water and ice then chug. If you mix it in a shake with a little milk, or maybe an extra spoonful of sugar, or a scoop of ice cream, it might be really good. Or you might end up with additional volume of bland.

You could be dead tired and take a scoop or two of this and be ready to lift.The pumps are what makes this stuff great to use. INCREDIBLE pumps. After an intense set of bicep curls I thought my skin was going to tear. It will make you look huge your entire workout. The creatine in it also makes you look bigger after a while.Then I had a routine blood test because of an illness.....High liver enzymes. The doctor expressed concerns about my high liver enzymes and asked about my diet. I mentioned I take a pre workout but he didnt seem too concerned with it. He retested me a few weeks later and was perplexed. His concern made me concerned, so I began to examine my lifestyle. I figured the only thing out of the norm was my protein supplementation and my pre-workout supplementation. After a quick internet search I came across similar concerns. I decided to check Amazon reviews and found the others with similar problems. I stopped taking this supplement immediately. About a month later I figured it was out of my system and set up an appointment for a blood test. Sure enough, it was normal.Since there is NO regulation from the FDA on these products, it is up to the consumer to educate themselves on what they are ingesting. DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT. Does it work? Yes. Does it do what it says it will? Yes. Does it damage your liver? YES. That isn't a trade-off I am willing to take. I know of many high school and college kids that abuse the hell out of this stuff and I would imagine they will have unpleasant consequences down the road.I would suggest taking a pre workout without a bunch of crap in it.

Many people take this just to get off blood pressure medicine and report a drop in 30pts or more- of course this is with a good diet.I always trusted the NOW brand and havent been dissapointed , we all need to look to supplements and alternatives to modern medicine cause they only provide band aids not solutionsPlease for refrence stay away from High Fructose Corn Syrup , its in many,many products- read the label people from soda, fast food,ketchup,ice cream,pickles, most sweets etc It tells the brain your not full and u keep eating and drinking more of it.Your body cant digest it and it sits on top of liver causing fatty liver disease,cirrocis,diabetes etc etc check out naturalnews dot com its a wealth of information",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

Siphotrol Plus Area Treatment For Homes-24 oz. spray,"One star off a bit reluctantly because it wasn't 100% effective immediately.Fleas are tenacious little buggers. We have two, long haired dogs. It's tough to see the fleas on furniture or in carpet, easier to find them on the dogs. In the past, Frontline Plus seemed to control or prevent the problem and prevent a house infestation, but not this year. Maybe it was the dry weather. It was a battle. We tried over the counter flea bombs, two brands; someplace between immeasurably marginal and a total waste of money.Based on the vet's recommendation, we tried the canned aerosol and this pump sprayer. Either is OK, more for your money with the pump sprayer. Also used a sticky paper Victor Ultimate Flea Trap (Amazon), but we use the flea trap more as a measure of how bad the infestation is; it will not solve the problem. Count the fleas trapped in 24 hours, when it gets down to 1 or 2 you just about have things under control. Zero and you can break out the champagne.The Siphotrol products seem to be largely effective immediately. The label says it kills adult fleas on contact and I won't argue with that but the critters seem to hide or hatch continuously. It certainly knocks down the population but it takes another week or so to eliminate the problem. It did not require a second application. Also, if you've chased fleas you know they're fast and elusive, but after the Siphotrol, if they're still living they're pretty lethargic.We used the Siphotrol product on the carpet and furniture, and Barklogic's Lemongrass Tick and Flea Pet Wash (Amazon) on the dogs, one application each and the problem was maybe 90+% resolved the first day, stragglers gone within a week. The Siphotrol has almost no smell, nothing residual. Though the dogs love to swim, they have always loathed a bath. FWIW there's something about this Lemongrass product that they both liked, very mild, pleasant aroma and you could see the fleas going down the drain.",pet supplies,dogs,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'health supplies')"
"Micro Mask, 1 oz","This product is specific to masking of hobby models or other small areas. You typically apply the product with a brush to area on the model that needs to be painted with a detail or design. When the solution drys you take an hobby knife and make an outline cut and pull away any excess material. (Lets say you wish to paint a square - you would make cuts in the material in the shape of a square - peel the square away leaving an area to be painted) It leaves a mask - almost like a stencil or painters tape. You can then paint the area. After painting you peal away the mask material and this leaves a clean line or painted design.It does take a little practice and you do need to use a lite touch when you use the hobby knife so as not to cut the surface you wish to paint.It is a helpful product, but you should practice using it on scrap material before moving to using it on the actual surface.",toys games,vehicles remote control,play trains railway sets,"('toys games', 'vehicles remote control', 'play trains railway sets')"

Omron HEM 705 CP Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with Printer,I bought the Omron BP monitor based on my doctors office recomendation for this brand. I had been using a very old Sunbeam BP monitor with built-in printer and loved it but my doctors office put it up against theirs and noted it wasn't getting the same numbers claiming mine needed replacement. So I found the Omron HEM-705CP which has a separate printer provided. Also because of the large circumferance of my arms I separately ordered the Omron H-003D large cuff. I think Amazon should offer the option to order which ever size cuff needed at the same time as the monitor is purchased. I feel the separate printer provided is not nearly as convenient as having it built in. Also I thought it was inconvenient to have to go to a different vendor for the large cuff. To make matters worse not only is the cuff longer as it should be but it's also wider which in my case is a problem. The distance between my under arm and my elbow is shorter then the width of the cuff so the cuff goes under my arm and past my elbow. Besides this problem it is the usual velcro arrangement and because of the subsequent poor fit I either have to ask my wife to help put the cuff on or lately I have managed to leave the velcro attached in the same position and just slide it on and off without detaching the velcro each time. it's awkward. I'm sure the large cuff fits properly on people with a larger frame. Mt doctors office has seen how this fits and thinks it best if my wife helps me with the cuff each time. This is not always an option.

Evriholder HR-STD Hi-Reach Cleaning Kit with 10-Foot Extension Pole,"I bought this item to clean the solar panels we had installed at the end of May.

MRM TribuPlex 750,"Did some reading on guys losing testosterone as they age and my hubby is 48 and I think he was feeling some of that (from listening to him describe the feeling); when he was not tired and getting his rest, he could already ""hit it like a rock star"" in the bedroom but...after trying this product, he told me he feels a BIG difference! I think it varies per person based on their t-levels and what they are taking in addition to this product (but that is just my guess); for us it's a winner! He says he feels more alive and I can certainly tell his mood is better. He seems to me to be like a younger man and we have more enjoyable conversations as a result (although that's not my favorite part...wink, wink); since I'm enjoying the bedroom activities as well being that much more fun, it's win-win for us! So, I'm on here ordering a second bottle now for him; it's only been about a month and it only took about a day or two before my guy noticed the difference (and by the way, he started off taking just one and says that 2 a day is best for him; think it is wise to start slow and then go up if your doctor says it's okay and the man feels comfortable with it)! We like this product and thank you, to the guys who reviewed it. I felt they helped my hubby decide if he wanted to give it a try and he's VERY glad he did; so am I!

Alex fashion weave loom with fluffy yarn ages 7+,The brand of the weave loom I purchase is different but the contents is exactly the same. Rainbow color yarn balls and the wooden loom. I purchase it bcuz I am always looking to expand my crafting skills and enjoy trying new things. With winter around the corner I wanted to learn different ways of making a scarf for Christmas gifting besides knitting and crochet. So I bought this wooden loom. I must admit it's a bit pricey but sorta worth it. The instructions aren't very detailed but YouTube has loom weaving vids that help make instructions alot more clearer to understand. I had to knock one star off bcuz of that and the fact that the box states 75 yards of yarn but really it's only good for making one scarf. Good thing I have a large stock of yarn and also it's kinda difficult to make a scarf bcuz the length of your woven item is short so the way you make a scarf is to weave up to the top of the loom then sew several pieces together to make it into a scarf length. It's really tedious and this loom is probably best only to make potholders or small pouches but not scarves or anything of that sort. Overall I think it's an okay gift to purchase but keep in mind if the gift receiver doesn't have much patience or unable to sit for long periods this may not be the best gift as it's very time consuming and requires lots of patience sitting on your caboose.*EDIT,toys games,arts crafts,craft kits,"('toys games', 'arts crafts', 'craft kits')"

Walkabout Harness - Medium/Large,"Absolutely the best harness for dogs that still have some function left in their hind legs. I have an 11 yr old blue merle collie who has mobility issues. I've been using this for about 6 weeks and as soon as I put it on and help my dog to his feet, he's ""up and running""!! I've noticed better muscle tone, a renewed interest in his walks and an allover improvement in him. It really gives the amount of support needed, I only have to hoist him to his feet and then keep a very slight pressure so as to allow him to still walk on his own. In the event he trips, I have control of his back end and he doesn't fall anymore. When he tires, I'll give a little more support to him in order for him to make it back home. His walks have gotten longer, and the other day, he even got up on his own. I'm hoping I will see more improvement in this area, but even if he doesn't ever reliably get himself up anymore, this harness has been worth it's weight in gold. I believe it's extended his life as I see a different attitude in him. I've used other harnesses, this is definitely the best!!!",pet supplies,dogs,collars,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'collars')"

Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax. Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey. For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey. Who knows?I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.

Futuro Stabilizing Back Support,"I recently purchased this product (I am a 62 year old male) to replace another Futuro lower back brace that I have worn out. Futuro no longer makes the brace I was using. This brace stabilizes a larger area of the lower back than the previous one I owned. When I first received this item I was skeptical that it would work as well, but have been surprised that it is an improvement over the older brace and so far it seems a bit more comfortable to wear. I have spinal stenois in my lower lumbar region caused by disc degeneration above and below L4 (comfimed by recent MRI). I need additional support from a brace like this for golfing, power walking and doing chores around my house that may irritate my lower back. This is not a brace for heavy lifting, but for giving your lumbar region extra support and keeping the vertebra lined up. Golfing is one thing I do that can really bother my lower back, but I can walk 9 holes in hot humid weather and not end up having a sore back the rest of the day. As I use this item through the next months I will update my review with any pros or cons that I have about this brace. However at this time I would say that if you need lower back support for spinal issues I would highly recommend that you try this item. The cost is modest for the benefits as far as I am concerned. One comment I would make is about the sizing, make sure you measure yourself around your naval area and do not use your pants waist size. I have a 34 inch waist and the small/medium size just fits me. I do believe that the material will streatch over time, as did the previous Futuro back stabilizing brace I replaced.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'braces')"

There is no ""smoothing"" it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it's still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I've tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn't cover the redness on my skin.

"Imperial 715C Swing Arm Extension Mirror 8"" - Chrome","This mirror works fine and extends nicely around our very large bathroom mirror.Seems well made although the mounting bracket of stamped metal is a little on the cheesy side. The instructions state to turn the mirror, not by flipping from one side to the other but by actually turning it on the pivot where it mounts to the arm. Pivoting the mirror is a little stiff and flipping causes the screws to back out. To solve both issues, I backed the screws out and applied a small dab of Loctite and re-screwed to a tension for flipping the mirror that held it nicely at the desired angle. Since there are not threads on the bracket, the screws now rotate with the mirror and don't back out. An easy fix, something they should do in manufacturing.

Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,"Sure Frontline Plus for Cats costs more than what you MIGHT be tempted to buy Over The Counter at the drug store or the Supermarket -- but those OTC products have killed or neurologically (seriously) damaged too many cats and dogs-- and I wonder why those OTC products are still being sold. As a new pet owner 20 yrs ago, I almost killed my cat with an OTC product-- I frantically called the vet immediately -- seconds after applying it and seeing my cat have a reaction -- and luckily all I had to do was put my cat under a warm shower and wash her off -- if I had waited any longer I would have had to take a very sick cat to the vet, with no guarantee of a full recovery.That being said, paying a little extra for Frontline For Cats is worth it -- in the long run you pay MUCH less than you would have to pay if you had to tke your cat to the vet for a life-threatening reaction to an OTC flea product(make sure you get a Cat product and not a Dog product as Cats' livers process chemicals differently than do dogs' livers- i.e., a cat CAN get poisoned by a dog product)Frontline Cat Plus starts working in (as I have observed) less than 24 hours-- make sure you apply it as indicated on the package. My Big Bad Baby Twinkle cat can turn her head almost 270 degrees, and she tries to lick it off the back of her neck, so I have to put a (soft) Elizabethan collar on her and monitor her for about 12 hours to make sure she doesn't walk into walls (that collar may impair her line of vision).Please DO montior your cat to make sure s/he does not have a (rare but it may happen) reaction to Frontline, but I have never seen that happen in all my 3 cats. At any sign of a reaction call the vet immediately.Other than that, when the fur dries, your cat is protected very well. Then it's up to you to remove the source of the problem - the fleas -- in blankets, bedding, on rugs, etc. Ihad to do that-- it was a chore but it certainly was worth it -- for me AND for my cat(s). If the infestatin is very heavy, please call your vet to see what else can be done. (I had to do that too)",pet supplies,cats,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'health supplies')"

By moving the white knobs, horizontal and vertical lines as well as curves can be drawn, allowing the user to draw countless objects.

It is fun both for adults, as well as children, although it is probably better for the 5+ age group rather than the 3+ age group, as advertised. While children under 3 can use the Etch A Sketch, it is a bit too difficult for 3-4 year-old children to make interesting objects with the dials so that age group often gets bored with it.While the Etch A Sketch has no bells, whistles, or computerized parts, it seems to be the toy that kids keep coming back to. Its simplistic design actually keeps it from becoming tiresome. I very much appreciated the quietness of the toy.The Etch A Sketch is particularly good with children who need to develop hand muscles, as continuous use of the dials requires intricate hand movements.

China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,"The color is AMAZING. obviously, its not 100% Tiffany Blue(copyright infringement and all that) but its VERY close. that being said, I wasn't really crazy for the way this polish goes on, its not very forgiving to mistakes, you have to be very specific about the pressure you use, otherwise, half of the nail will have color, and the other won't. also, this color starts to get tacky VERY quickly, within about 5 seconds, normally, that would be wonderful, but you have to go over this to correct it when you mess up, but when its tacky, it doesn't really behave the way you want it to.",beauty,makeup,nails,"('beauty', 'makeup', 'nails')"

The food itself, at least from the west coast plant which is where mine came from, is excellent quality and I fed this to my kittens and fed the dog food to my dogs. However I won't be buying it anymore since the price hike and I actually ended up switching to a local brand where I know exactly what is going into my ""kids'"" food and I'm getting the same amount for $1.50 more.

"Simple Solution Stain & Odor Remover, 32 Ounce","I have a male and female chihuahua. Though they both are fixed, the male feels he must mark everything in the spring and fall.I was at my wits end when I finally saw this product.I don't know why there are reviews that say it has a strong odor. I am very sensitve to this and did not find any odor at all.Just spray, dab and let dry. I used it on old and new spots. Works perfect the first time on the new spots and they do not reapeare. On old spots that have been gone over with a rug cleaner containing hot water, I did find that I need to do it again since they reapeared after a couple of weeks. The 2nd try worked perfect.I also used it on some blueberry pie filling my son dropped on the rug, which had dried. For this I had to do twice also, but it did work.As the bottle recommends, you really must saturate the area or it will not work well. After going through 2 bottles, I found that tilting the bottle and spraying the rug from an angle, as opposed to straight down, you will use much less, yet it will work just as well.I highly recommend this product.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"
"Urine Off Odor and Stain Remover for Cats, 1 Gallon","This would be a 5 star review if it hadn't been for a couple little quirky things that I will mention first:Cons:1) shape of the jug and handle creates a mess when trying to pour product into a smaller spray bottle - I use two of theseRubbermaid Commercial FG9C0301 HDPE 3.3 cc Spray Trigger. I have experienced a little more waste than I would like. This was solved by a funnel.2) This product seems to be much stickier than any of the other enzyme products I have used such asMisterMaxAnti Icky Poo - 1 GallonandNature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover, 32-Ounceamong others. When using this product on vomit or urine / feces on a laminate floor, it tends to leave a sticky residue where the others have not. This product seems a little thicker in viscosity.Pros:1) I like the smell, it's almost fruity. The smell does not bother our cats at all.2) We use multipleBooda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box, Titaniumboxes for our 6 kitties and this stuff does a remarkable job of cleaning any urine spray off of the sides/edges of the dome. Some of our older cats aren't quite as accurate with the litter box because of hip issues. Urine off cleans old urine smell and stains off of litter box surfaces with one swipe.This is strong stuff. It is working for cat smells (urine, vomit, feces). It isn't the cheapest nor the most expensive.I'll definitely keep using this going forward despite my 3-star review. It seems to do the best job compared to the stuff I've bought off of Amazon and from the Big Box stores.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

Unfortunately, after just one day with him at daycare, Scruff came home with a huge hole in the seam on the back. Luckily, our son hadn't noticed, and Scruff still had all of his stuffing and beads. I was able to ""operate"" and sew him back up to be used. However, I'm very disappointed that after just one day of use (and not rough use), Scruff needed repairs. My four-year-old's dog was mine when I was young and has never needed fixing. As long as you can sew any busted seams, it's a worthwhile purchase.

L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl,"I have a couple of different nursing covers [Bebe Au Lait, MyBrestFriend, & Udder Cover] but I decided to try this one because it covers the back too. I thought this cover would provide great 360* coverage, but what it really provides is only front & back coverage with insufficient side coverage. Especially if you have a squirmy baby! The front & back are a good length but the sides are drastically shorter, making the entire cover full of gaps. It is also hard to see down inside of the cover without the rigid neckline that comes standard in a Bebe Au Lait. The fabric is about twice as thick as my other covers, so I think it'd be unbearable during summer. But I do tend to run warm these days! ;)Lastly the little pouch is a nice idea, but who has the time to fold a cover up once baby's done eating?

Merry Pet Products-Cat Washroom And Night Stand,"One star is being quite generous... The idea behind this is great -- but the shape is just wrong for every litter box I could find (aside from the really small, shallow ones for kittens) -- it just isn't deep enough. I ended up buying a small dishpan to use, and it just barely fits -- my goal was to have the cat get out of the litterbox inside, so that litter wouldn't end up all over the floor. This is next to impossible. And I fortunately listened to other reviews suggesting that the furniture piece be lined with contact paper before using, because if you have a cat over 5 pounds, there just isn't enough room for them, and they are constantly peeing over the edge of the litter box. So great idea, but poor design. Assembly was okay -- we found that some of the screws didn't go in straight, and ended up poking through the cheap wood side pieces.

I had read reviews about customers receiving counterfeit fragrances from Amazon marketplace sellers in the past, so I weeded through the sellers to find one that appeared to be legit. In hindsight, I should have spent slightly more money and gone with the nationwide fragrance chain store that was also selling on Amazon. Then I could have been certain that what I was ordering was legit and I could have stopped into their bricks and mortar store here locally if there were issues.The product packaging for my order was all top notch and very genuine looking. The labels, wrapping, box, and even the printing on the bottle was all crisp and precise. It passed my visual test.The fragrance smells the part, so that passed my sniffer test. I thought all was good.After a few weeks of daily use, here is what I can say",beauty,fragrance,men s,"('beauty', 'fragrance', 'men s')"

Throughly Clean Face Wash - Original - 8 oz. (250 ml) - Liquid,"We have used this soap not just as face wash, but body wash and hand soap as well for years. Nothing else even comes close and we would never use anything else. (For hand soap, we dilute it with a 1/2 solution of acid water from our Orion Jupiter water filter that is anti-septic--so gentle, and such a natural way to disinfect without chemicals of any kind.) Every time I have to use some other soap or we are without it, I realize how much I rely on this stuff and how great it is. It cleans so gently and thoroughly without any residues of any kind. Highly concentrated, you only need a very little amount, so it goes a long time if you use it appropriately. We dilute it for this reason especially with the kids as they have the tendency to forget having to use other soaps at school and other places where you need a whole lot to get clean. They often complain about how other soaps 'don't wash off' no matter how long you rinse for, and it winds up drying out their hands as a result and in winter, it cracks them and hurts! I have highly sensitive skin so I'm very careful about everything and anything I use on my skin, and this is so gentle yet powerful, natural and leaves no residue at all! It is simply the best. Also it doesn't smell which is really nice-- just a very light, almost non-existent lemony type smell--just clean. Great for the chemically sensitive or peeps who just hate strong smells. Soaps usually stink too! This doesn't. So nice. This brand is better than anything else--and it has to be the face wash--or else you just get what is castile soap basically without the benefits of the tea tree. My family generally has very clear skin-- but for the occasional blemish, we'll put a drop on the blemish and let it dry overnight, and usually by morning it will be either gone or greatly diminished especially after a hot water compress first. With two teenagers, this helps them tremendously keep clear and free of acne. I would highly recommend this product, even more for people who have sensitive skin, chemical sensitivities, or skin issues in general. We love this stuff. Also, buying it in the 32 fl oz is a huge savings and a great deal. Can't go wrong with this one.",beauty,skin care,face,"('beauty', 'skin care', 'face')"

Ravensburger Make 'N' Break - Family Game,"This is a pretty fun game for kids. On a player's turn a card is drawn with an image of a structure that the player has to build with the blocks. Some require the same colored blocks in the exact places, and other cards only require the structure, so colored blocks can be used any way desired. There is a timer and a player can build as many structures as they're able until the timer goes off. There are also two decks of cards, an easier group and a harder group. Even with me using the harder cards and my 8 y.o. using the easier ones, I really had to purposefully slow myself down in order to make the game seem close and not beat her with a landslide.Our daughter loves games and we try to find games that we can play with her without us having to ""dumb ourselves down"" (for lack of a better description) and pretend it's harder than it is in order to play it with her. There are a lot of games out there that adults can play with kids in which they can fully use their own skills and knowledge which makes it more enjoyable (forbidden island is a great example and is our current favorite kids game). To us it feels patronizing and untruthful to have to ""pretend"" that a game is harder or more interesting than it really is in order to play it with our daughter. We'd rather play games that really are engaging for all ages rather than pretending that they are.If you have kids that will play together then this game would be great for them. For adults playing with kids, you'll have to pretend it's harder than it is or else you'll easily beat the kids which isn't very fun or fair for them.",toys games,games,board games,"('toys games', 'games', 'board games')"

When you were young, were you ever feeling adventurous and wondered what your pet Fido's dog biscuits tasted like? I did and used to chew half-heartedly on one now and then.

Go with the easy walk and still have a bit of pulling, but your dog won't mind wearing it.

"Bed Wedge-Foam Wedge Pillow. Good for Acid Reflux, Snoring.","This is a revised review. Changed from 4 stars to 3 stars after using it for a while.This review is for the 12"" BED WEDGE Pillow by DMI (Duro-Med Industries), distributed by Briggs Medical. I've posted photos with additional details.I purchased this pillow for my husband's regular use and my occasional use. My husband uses it for two reasons:1. To reduce congestion my husband experiences in his nose, throat, and chest during sleep.2. To be able to see the television better while lying in bed.It allows you to elivate your head so you can see the television while lying in bed (we still have to add one or two regular bed pillows for comfort), which is better than piling up 4 or 5 pillows as we've done for years. And (more importantly) my husband's sinuses don't drain into the back of his throat and make him choke & gurgle and snore while sleeping. But we have a few other comments.THIS IS AN ADDED COMMENT, ENTERED ON 11-16-12, AFTER I FIRST CREATED THIS REVIEW ON 10-20-12:At first my husband told me he was very happy with this pillow, after he used it for a few days, but now that he's had it for about 4 weeks he rarely uses it. He now says it makes him feel like he's sliding down onto his elbows and it puts pressure on his elbows and butt. Another reviewer said the same thing. I honestly really do not understand how this could be, because he has been piling up pillows to produce the same reclining position for years. The only thing I can think is that the firmness of the pillow is the problem - instead of your body sinking in and getting comfortable, you slide down it like a, well, like a slide, because it's so firm. This is why I changed the star rating today from 4 to 3, because my husband now doesn't like to use it to sleep. He only uses it once in a while to watch TV while lying down. Not worth the money I spent. I think they really need to make these pillows softer. All of the other information in my review, below, still stands as true.OKAY, BUT COULD USE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS:My husband and I both feel this pillow is a bit too firm, but we also realize if it were softer then it wouldn't do as good a job of lifting his head - his head and shoulders would instead sink down. So, we feel the firmness is needed, just not as firm as it is now. To make it more comfortable against his body he places a layer of soft pillows on top of the wedge.

Basically the leash is a big rubber band built into the collar. Problem is the rubber is so strong and requires constant pressure to keep extented, it is really ONLY for EMERGENCY use. I do not see it being useful as I daily use leash. Also, the extra material does add some weight to the collar.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'collars')"

Hinged Elevated Toilet Seat,"I have three American Standard builder-grade toilets in the home, all with builder-grade seats and lids, nothing fancy. For the two upstairs (more private) toilets, I purchased two ofInvacare Raised Toilet Seat. For the downstairs, more public toilet, the Hinged Elevating Toilet Seat fit the bill perfectly.Installation instructions are exceedingly sketchy (picture on the side of the box without explanation, and some assembly required), so here are my tips/tricks:1) Clean and remove completely the existing toilet seat and lid, setting aside ONLY the bolts holding them to the toilet. You won't need these again unless you uninstall the product.2) Identify the tops/bottoms of the hinged raised seat and bracket holder (my names for them). The top of the raised seat is absolutely smooth, with a small rim on the bottom side (installed towards the toilet bowl rim). The top of the bracket holder is completely smooth and the bottom of the bracket holder has a plastic recycle code on it.2) On a secure surface, such as padded carpet, place the bracket holder flat side down (curved side up). Align the raised seat with the ""slide into place"" slots on the sides of the bracket, making sure both sides match as to ""up"" and ""down"" in the final installation (completely smooth side of seat aligned with the completely smooth side of the bracket).

Chicco C6 Stroller,"I got this stroller b/c my friend raved about how wonderful it was. I already own a Maclaren XLR and wanted to downsize to a sturdy smaller stroller b/c the Maclaren is too heavy.

It was much more difficult to maneuver than my $20 Babies R US stroller (which I LOVED, but it got worn out after a year...hence the search for a better quality umbrella stroller).

Moom Nourishing Hair Remover,"I love this stuff! I bought some years ago because I was sick and tired of spending an hour in the bathroom plucking my eyebrows one by one. Too time consuming and it was always painful. Wax... well, after seeing my mother use it on herself (and I still can't get the smell of microwaved wax out of my memory, ewww!) and how she struggled with it, I never wanted to even try that stuff. So I'm so glad I found Moom. It works very much the same way as wax, but smells much better and doesn't hurt nearly as much as I was afraid it would. Not going to lie, it is going to hurt a bit. You are ripping little hairs from your body, it's just inevitable there will be pain of some sort.Moom is nice in that you don't HAVE to heat it up, but there have been times during colder months that I find it's more solid than usual. In that event, I do pop it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds and then wait for it cool down a bit before I use it on my skin. The muslin strips are also a nice touch. There are two sizes of strips- small and HUGE and I rarely ever need to use the latter. It includes two sizes of ""applicators"" as well which are really nothing more than wooden popsicle sticks or tongue depressors, again one set thin and the other wide (I use the thin one). The sticks and fabrics bits are easy to clean, just use soap and water and let them air dry.Moom is easy to apply, almost too easy. I'd caution anyone who uses it that LESS IS MORE! You can always remove more hair, you can't replace it once it's gone nearly as easily so take your time and apply with care. Oh yeah, remember to wash your face BEFORE you use it. You really do need to remove any natural oils otherwise it won't work nearly as well (I've forgotten a few times with frustrating results). And always have some moisturizer on hand afterwards to apply to the spots where hair was removed, it will be tender and might get dried out. Moisturizer will help that.

Bioderma Crealine H2o Ultra-mild Non-rinse Face and Eyes Cleanser,"I found out about this product from Lisa Eldridge who is one of the top makeup artists in the world.[...]I feel that if she uses it everyday it must be good because since she has access to so many products and also because she is in the industry she has tried many. So I gave it a try. I used to use the Clinique eye make up remover and comparing the two, I found that the Clinique one was too oily and could have the tendency to get in my pours and cause problems. The Bioderma Crealine H20 solution feels like plain water but it takes all makeup off within seconds. If I have false lashes on all I do is apply some to a square cotton pad, press pad on eye for about a minute then just slide the pad down everything comes off without any rubbing or pulling your eye.

Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Freezer Trays With Lids,"I bought these so I could store homemade baby food and I like them a lot. It's a great deal comparing to other baby food freezing trays.I was a little concerned when I read the negative review about:1. how it's hard to get the cubes out2.how the tray cracks easily3. The cover does not fit.Well, these problems are nothing to worry about.First of all, when you get the trays, it says in the manual if the cover does not fit right, submerge it in hot water, then put it on the tray and let cool. This will make sure the cover fit perfectly. I did this since the covers were a bit hard to put on, and it worked out perfectly.Second, like other reviews mentioned, when you are getting the cubes out, you need to run it under hot water for 30 seconds or so, then it's so easy to get them out.This bring the third thing,the trays are hard, not flexible, so you can't twist it to get the cubes out. Like I mentioned, I run the frozen tray under hot water, flip the tray so the cover is at the bottom, then I smash it lightly on the counter top, you could hear the cubes got loosened from the tray.

Transformers G1 Commemorative Series I Hot Rod Reissue Figure ( Rodimus Major ),"Hot Rod is my favorite Transformers Character of all time. When I was little I begged and begged my parents for Hot Rod for Christmas,my birthday and every other holiday and I never did get him. Finally upon High school graduation I got two gifts. One of which was a Gibson Les Paul modeled after Sully Erna's from Godsmack and...Hot Rod. Bet you can't guess which was my favorite.I was super excited to get Hot Rod finally after waiting 15 fricken years.My grandma always told me ""dont worry you'll find him one day"" (I would make here sit down and watch Transformers with me...then later on actually got her into Gundam) I never did believe her. So....this is a review 15+ years in the making.Hot Rod transforms into a modified Lamborghini Countach, Red with flames on the hood and sides...and lets not forget the big yellow spoiler and chrome exaust pipes. Before I actually get into this review I'm pretending any Transformers product that came out after G1 Does not exist so I can give a better review. Vehicle mode is really nice. Rolls super well and like a lot of G1 figures holds into place very well.Hot Rod sports rubber wheels. I prefer that over plastic any day. I think it adds a more realistic touch. There is also a peg hole in the exposed engine block where you can peg in one of two weapons that Hot Rod comes with. I think it looks better with no weapons but that's just me. Vehicle mode is a little over scaled compared to Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus but Hot Rod can easily fit on Ultra Magnus's Trailer. Hot Rod is also as screen accurate as you're going to get. Some of the G1 Transformers transform ridiculously complex in the show and movie so Hasbro had to compensate in both Vehicle mode and Robot mode.Transformation is a breeze.Simply pull the legs back and flip out the toes.Flip the arms on each side so the exhaust pipes are parallel to the car.Flip out the hood, Rotate the engine block to reveal Hot Rods head and snap in place. Next Rotate his ""belt buckle"" around and bring the hood down to peg into the top of the belt buckle. Rotate the spoiler/cab section around so that the Spoiler is behind Hot Rods Shoulders.Next just pose the arms and you're done. Pretty simple.Robot mode...to this day still looks awesome!.There isn't that much poseability except in this elbows and wrists and mid bicept.Head sculpt looks great. Not like Optimus Prime's where it vaguely resembles the actually head of the bot in the show. Hot Rods is pretty much dead on.Both of Hot Rods weapons can be held. Makes him look pretty bada$$ too.Overall this is a GREAT figure. I am not being bias when I say that. This really is a must have for your collection. It's a Classic, A great looking car and robot...well...It's Hot Rod. nuff said.",toys games,action toy figures,figures,"('toys games', 'action toy figures', 'figures')"
Innotek Lap Dog Trainer,"The collar only has 4 levels. My dog ignored level 1. He yelped and jumped for level 2. The training said a level with that reaction should only be used for behavioral corrections and not basic training. The support line was no help. No background questions of where the collar was placed or how I was trying to train to brainstorm how I could get the product to work for my dog. At minimum, I thought maybe I should loosen the collar, or move the prongs to the back of the neck, or remove one of the prongs. But there were absolutely no suggestions other than being told there was no 1.5 level, which was of course obvious.I was also concerned with the training collar coming into contact with metal on his other collars. The support line told me he should not be wearing other collars and should have a harness. No where else was this mentioned. My dog is an Italian Greyhound. His chest is too deep for a harness and must wear a martingale collar.I was told I would have to check with the retail store to return the collar. Returning the product is not an option asI had already opened the package and cut the collar as instructed (since it was so long my dog was tripping over it--too long for a product geared to lap dogs). There was no discussion that maybe the collar was defunct and that another might not have Level 2 set so strong.",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'training behavior aids')"

Lice and Nit Eliminating Natural Mousse with Foam Applicator Kit,"We experienced lice for the first time last year (my daughter caught them in her kindergarten class) and tried everything--even the poison stuff! While the essential oils and diligent combing worked better than Kwellada, none of these irradicated the little buggers.

So, I ordered this (and the Terminator comb--you must spend the few extra dollars on a good comb from the start--the drugstore ones do not last, as the ""fingers"" start to loosen and move) on Ebay and could not be happier.

She likes to chew, but she is still pretty awesome.On the other hand, my mom has three weiner dogs. One of them decided a corner of the wall tasted delicious, so she went out & bought bitter apple.

Nature's Way Horsechestnut Standardized Extract,"I started ordering horsechestnut sometime in the fall of 2011. I was using a different brand until trying this one. I think they're both good brands but I like this one better. If you have problems with edema in your legs due to vein problems like spider veins or varicose veins then give this a try. As long as I take this twice a day, my legs feel so much better.Also try some hydrotherapy and avoid a shower head with forceful water pressure. Use a shower head that let's the water run out gently on your skin. I found that the forceful water pressure on my shower head was adding to my leg aches and circulation issues, it made them worse. When your done showering, let a little cool water or cold water run down your body or just your legs for a few minutes (not too long) or take a cool bath OR a warm bath with epsom salt.Aloe vera gel is also good for soothing leg aches due to painful varicose veins. You should also give that a try in combination with horsechestnut. And definitely research about hydrotherapy, it really does help.

"Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)","Ive been quite happy with Felidae canned products.They are reasonably inexpensive if you look at the price per oz which you should always do.The ingredients are noteworthy for several reasons.1) Because of very limited grains. Cats cant process grains but you have to have something to hold the kibble together. They use alfalfa and brown rice which is better than corn.2) No meat by-products or even 'meal'. Meal/byproducts could be anything pretty much. It could be perfectly fine organ meat that humans don't eat a lot of, so theres a good supply. It could be feathers, gristle, whatever. It's generally best to avoid when possible.3) The first seven ingredients are meat-based. This means a very limited amount of filler as an 8th ingredient could only theoretically be less than 12.5% of the whole product by weight.4) The variety of meats is also beneficial, especially inclusion of liver which is nutritious.It is a good idea to feed your cat at least some canned wet food to ensure kitty gets enough water. We also feed her some dry food as snacks, and have a pet fountain (steel) to encourage water drinking.Best of all, my cat loves it!",pet supplies,cats,food,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'food')"

The grip on the bottom is great, the handles are great, and it lips over the edge on the toilet enough that it protects hands from touching the toilet. I think it fits better on oblong toilets, which is what most public toilets are. If there is any down side, it would be the open part on the front...don't expect a splash guard. You will have to help a little boy point things down into the toilet. I don't find it to be a problem. The hole is not as big as a standard potty seat, so it might take a little assistance adjusting for what your child ""needs to do"" in the potty.

Rodger Wireless Bedwetting Alarm System,"Bought this for my 7 year old son who is a VERY sound sleeper.

I've been trying for 2-3 years to get my son to use the bathroom at night!For the first week the alarm didn't seem to wake him much until he was already quite wet and I would hear the alarm from my room across the hall, get up and help him out.The second and third weeks he started getting out of bed on his own, turning the alarm off himself (which was near the floor by his door), and going to the bathroom, AND changing the underwear with the sensor himself (I had bought 4 pairs)! Sometimes he was pretty wet, other times, almost dry. I actually didn't hear the alarm go off because he would get up so quickly to turn it off! And he's on the top bed of a bunk bed! I asked him what made him get up so quickly lately and he told me the alarm was SOOOO annoying that he couldn't stand the noise!! (I had switched the noise from a single, more calming noise, to the rotating annoying noises).The last week my son was dry all night!

PlasmaCar Red,"The car is lightweight but well built. Not very hard to put together. Packaging suffices to get it to your door with damage.

I was lured in by the cheap price when I should have just stuck to the Tetra brand, which I finally did after returning the Top Fin 20.The Whisper 20 is what it claims to be--whisper quiet, although this is really a subjective opinion. You can still hear some slight buzzing, but compared to other air pumps, it is relatively quite. It provides a strong stream of air for your aquarium air stones or other devices. Tetra also includes a free air valve, which is a nice touch.If you're looking for a reliable and relatively silent air pump at a reasonable price, the Whisper 20 is a product to consider.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,pumps filters,"('pet supplies', 'fish aquatic pets', 'pumps filters')"

Chicco C6 Stroller,"I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4"".5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag. I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK. A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the ""basket"". I wouldn't even call it that but it's there. I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back.

Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame,"The idea is very nice. We made the first one a bit too thick (not easy to get ""just the right thickness"") because too thin and the material is too mushy when baby's foot goes in... too thick and it will press against the glass of the frame when assembled (which we discovered only after it dried). So, second time around avoided the sticking to aluminum foil issue noted by others and used wax paper which is much better. Forgot about the fact that the rolling pin is actually a ""sticking pin"" because the materials adheres to it like glue. Best way to manage this product is to kneed as directed, then push onto wide piece of wax paper into rectangle shape, fold the other half of wax paper over it and use the rolling pin on that. Learned too late and rolling pin was covered with the material which won't come off because the wood is porous... oh well. So, at this point you have 2 utter failings (happened both times to us) of this product... sticks to aluminum foil and sticks to the rolling pin... both of which are part of the explicit instructions to use. If you do, I hope your experience is better than ours. Finally got it flat by folding wax paper over on top and then pressing with a hardback book which worked pretty well. Put our kiddos foot on it... and it stuck to her foot completely messing it up and requiring a start from scratch. Next time around, put a bit of lotion on her foot and it made imprint well and came out without any mess. In summary, great concept with terrible execution. Our home is 70 degrees, not particularly dry or humid, used on flat surface, baby's feet are clean. For us, this material has been very high maintenance, requiring almost complete deviation from the directions to get it to work. Oh yes, and when using the included ruler to cut the material and make edges straight, must be very forceful and deliberate about pressing through material, rocking back and forth to cut all the strands or it will also tear out shrapnel of material from the side, messing up your imprint. If you wait until it dries to cut the shape straight on the sides you get a weird puckering effect in the material. Overall, the directions seem simple enough but, like others who wrote reviews, perils abound when following what seems like a straightforward process. Still waiting on final product to dry. Last note... be careful how thick you make it if you are going to use the double sided tape provided because it actually adds just enough height that it might cause the top edges of the imprint to press against the inner glass of the frame and distort the foot impression :-O One star is for the creativity factor and the fact that no one else seems to have anything like this available. Otherwise, this is a 2-star product for all the problematic issues from start to finish.",baby products,gifts,keepsakes,"('baby products', 'gifts', 'keepsakes')"

He comes with his hat,cane, & bellow w/ tube, to put in his back. First you put the open end of the tube (other end attached to bellow) and then squeeze the bellow. It will fill w/ water after you quit squeezing it. Then just put the open end of the tube into/over this piece on Joker's back. Then when you squeeze the bellow again, water shoots out of his Orchid on his jacket! His legs can move & his knees bend. His arms move, but don't bend @ the elbows. His head can move left to right. This figure is a classic toy & great addition to any vintage/old school toy collector. This Joker is based off the Batman movie. Which has Jack Nicholson playing The Joker.

As a result of the extensive tests, they found a very invasive rectal carcinoma. Our last resort was to due a kidney biopsy and possibly surgery to maybe remove his kidney, however due to the rectal cancer we felt it would be putting him through a procedure that was not guranateed to fix the bleeding and was not going to fix the other. At this point he was bleeding excessively, frank red blood. The university vet recommended this product to be used carefully. He was on it for 2 days and his bleeding stopped, I tappered down the dose as recommended and his urine cleared. That was in June, he's had only one episode recently when his urine started to get darker (blood tinged) so I gave him this right away for a couple of days, then tapered down. He has only had 1 episode since June, he is happy, I am not sure how long he will be with us, but at least he will be comfortable and loved. He was given 6 months, but you would never know it!.

Body Shop Cocoa Butter Body Butter 6.9 Oz.,"I have really dry skin and this body butter really helps. It's very rich. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It also has a great smell. I have been using this for both my dry skin and my stretch marks for almost a year. So far, I have not really noticed a difference for my stretch marks. However, I don't have to reapply lotion several times a day. The only places I do reapply are my knees. This is great for both day and night, but especially night because your body will absorb it and you won't wake up feeling like a snake. I use it right after a shower because I feel like I use less of the product when my body is still wet. Because it's so rich I sometimes use this as shaving creme and it works great. I love the smell, it's a very clean scent that's not too floral or sweet. I feel that the price is very good because you end up not having to use as much (especially after a bath) because it's very concentrated compared to regular lotion.Some people may this product too greasy or oily; and it can be a little on the heavy side. It's really a personal choice when it comes to how ""greasy/oily"" something feels. I like the feel of this body butter and I'll wipe some off if I feel a little too greasy. I think if you do not like that, this product may not be for you, and perhaps it would be best to try the Body Shop lotions instead of the body butter. My mother does not like this because she said it was too oily, but she likes the Vitamin E version of the body butters.Pros:1. Very rich and keeps skin smooth.2. Smells good.3.

Paris Hilton Fragrances - Just Me Men Spray,"For the curiosity, I picked up Just Me... It is a great buy at just over $20.00 and should be given consideration adding to your collection.

There is a ""but"" - the scent, at least coupled with my body chemistry, does not last. If you have an extensive collection - no problem - take the bottle with you and reapply as needed. While no compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, my girlfriend does like smelling the fragrance just following the initial application.Given the fresh/cleanliness of the fragrance, it can be worn for any occasion. While it can also be worn anytime of year, I would imagine with citrus(y) basenotes, probably spring and summer are the best times of year for Just Me...To reiterate, Just Me is a good fresh scent that lacks staying power.

Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,"Here are the most common concerns I hear from my friends when I rave about my diva cup:1. It looks like it hurts.It doesn't hurt at all. It's a little awkward putting it in the first time, sure. But by the third time, I was a pro. And I'm one of those girls that hates speculums and cried putting in a tampon for the first time. No joke. It's soft and malleable and gets even softer with your body heat.2. I don't like looking at blood.Ok, if you're squeamish, this may not be the best product for you. You have to empty it out in the toilet (though you can just not look). But in my opinion, if you're female... get over it. It's a natural part of life and you will have to look at blood at least once a month for over 30 years of your life (around there). And hey, this way you won't have dirty pads and tampons hanging out in your bathroom (your roommates and/or significant other will thank you, I'm sure).3. It can't handle heavy flow.My friend and I have HEAVY flows. I can go through a tampon in 45 minutes. This is a lifesaver for heavy flows! I just suggest that on your heaviest days (and definitely if you are new to the Diva Cup) you wear a pantyliner to protect your underwear just in case.4. Public toilets?!Been there. I just empty it, wipe it with toilet paper, and put it back in. Don't even skip a beat. And how often are you using public toilets really? You can wear it up to TWELVE hours. Unless you have a heavy flow, you can last an entire work day without thinking about your period. Sweet.5. Is it sanitary?Silicone is inert, so you don't have to worry about developing an allergy or sensitivity. AND definitely far more safe than tampons.. toxic shock anyone? I consider it more sanitary than pads though.. where you are essentially sitting on your own blood all day. Sure, they're absorbent, but your blood is still exposed to air and bacteria. ALSO they are contributing to those islands of trash we are creating.6. Sex.Non-penetrative sex during your period.

Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo w/ New Packaging,"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled, uncolored and normal hair, but with oily and acne-prone scalp and skin.I was nervous about using this shampoo; so much so that I decided to wait until the weekend to use it in case I needed to wash it out quickly. Though I don't have sensitive skin in the least (thank goodness) some of the primary ingredients can cause irritation, redness and itching or burning on even the toughest of hides. The scent is rather strongly medicinal, and strongly scented products can trigger migraines in me. I also wasn't sure how some of the oils in it would affect my acne-prone skin. I pretty much NEVER blow-dry my hair, preferring to make time to let it air dry, since it isn't that thick. So I had some reservations going into this. But much to my surprise, it made my hair soft, smooth and very easy to brush after it dried, without making it the least bit oily-looking, even on the second day! It also had no ill effect on my skin or scalp; no itching or burning, no clogged pores or pimples. I never use a rinse-out conditioner, but I do use a leave-in on the ends of my hair, and that was all I needed. I wouldn't use this every day, but I don't see why anyone else couldn't, provided they don't have very sensitive or dry skin or hair. It's probably especially good for those with skin conditions like excema. And the scent, while strong, gave me no headache at all; indeed, it's quite good for one's sinuses if they happen to be clogged.

Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,"With reasonable expectations you should be pleased with this product. Our wire-haired fox terrier always has to ""have the last bark"" with neighboring dogs (typical stubborn, willful terrier traits) -- this behavior has dramatically improved. The device works well within these paramaters:1) For our yard configuration, it's a ""line of sight"" type of device -- depending on the size of your yard, it may not impact your neighbor's dogs, random wandering bands of dogs, or your own dog if s/he is too far away (such as around the other side of the house). It has a very long cord, so I move it around every week or so, and the dog hasn't figured it out.2) It doesn't stop barking, it interrupts a barking sequence -- for it to work, you dog has to be repeatedly barking. It appears to distract the dog, taking the steam out of the barking episode. The device doesn't prevent all barking, and the dog has to get going on a string of repeated barks for impact. But, it does interrupt the cycle, and shorten the cycles for my dog. She may bark once or twice, then kind of give up - she has a weird ""half bark"" when the tone goes off, and then it's pretty much over.3) It doesn't put a big dent in ""barking for a cause"" - such as a brazen cat wandering along the fence top, taunting the dog. When there's a good reason (in dog logic) to bark vigorously, my dog is unphased by the device, initially. She does seem loose interest in the barking sooner, though.All in all, happy with the purchase, and would recommend.Update February 2013 -- still working! Dog woke me up at 5 am barking (a rarity now), but again, 4-5 barks at a time, then she basically gives up. Very happy with this result for my dog/yard combination!",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'training behavior aids')"

Grossan Hydro Pulse Nasal and Sinus Irrigation System with the Original Grossan Sinus Tip,"First of all, let me praise the use of nasal irrigation for allergy relief. I've also found that the powered ones (like both the Hydro Pulse and the SinuPulse) work better than syringes and the like.As far as I can tell there are two main units available, this Grossan unit and SinuPulse. The Grossan unit was made in Taiwan, and the SinuPulse in mainland China. I owned a Grossan unit for a couple years, lightly used during allergy season, before it died. Read the reviews -- it's apparently a fairly common problem. Upon disassembly, the cause was the motor armature binding (not burnt out, just frozen unless disassembled to the point the end cap was loose). The cheap plastic piston pump still moved fairly freely and there was no build up of salt since I had flushed the unit with distilled water after every use.A SinuPulse recently arrived -- it's far too early to tell how well it will hold up. However, I can compare the designs, ease of use, and the effectiveness.Effectiveness? They're about the same. Both also have a range of pressure adjustments and both want to be used more to the upper end.Ease of use? I'd put the Grossan unit ahead. Its fluid chamber is a fairly durable container that can serve for both mixing the salt solution and then dispense it. The SinuPulse unit has a squarish unit of a more fragile plastic (and not covered by the warranty) that doesn't work well for mixing (hard to hold, square corners, easily scratched, harder to drain). So you'll need an extra container to mix the saline solution with the SinuPulse.Design? It's a closer call on some of the design features. The SinuPulse makes it slightly easier to change nozzles with a push button to release, if that's important (not to me). The Grossan has a more useful on-off device at the handle while the SinuPulse has an annoying momentary contact (probably just presses against the tube) off option. The solution container on the Grossan unit is a more durable plastic and easier to clean, but the shut off valve on the bottom will leak now and then (not sure yet how the SinuPulse compares). Both units require a thorough flush with (preferably distilled) water to avoid salt or hard water deposits from clogging the pump. Both instruction manuals have unrealistic expectations, such as unplugging the units (they have an on-off switch) after every use.Price? About the same.Reliability? Don't have a real comparison yet. The Grossan seems to last a couple years in average use before dying. The SinuPulse has a two year warranty (versus one year for the Grossan). Both look to be somewhat cheaply made in China. Both warn that you must flush the unit after every use to get rid of any salt that might remain in the pump. If you have hard water, you probably should also use distilled water for this.The bottom line is that someone should be able to make a better unit for the $80 or so these cost. If the SinuPulse actually lasts significantly longer, it might be worth putting up with its annoyances. Otherwise, the Grossan looks to be the slightly better designed unit, at the cost of replacement every year or two or so (which will add up to a heap of broken units over a lifetime of use).",health personal care,health care,allergy,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'allergy')"

SnugglePuppie&trade; - Brown Mutt,"We received a snuggle puppy right after our 8 week old labradoodle puppy arrived. While his first two nights were a little rough with whining, the first night with snuggle puppy he went to sleep in his crate with his mouth on her and slept all night. Five months later he wouldn't consider going to bed without his ""puppy"". We know he is ready to go to bed when he goes and gets her. In the morning the first thing he does is go back into his bed and get his ""puppy"" to bring downstairs. In times of stress (thunderstorms being alone, when his tummy was upset) he will go and get the puppy and just lie with her under his chin. Our snuggle puppy has been thrown in the wash weekly (we always redo the velcro after removing the heart), and washes up beautifully. Our big puppy is not terribly hard on his stuffed toys but we have not noticed any damage. As for the battery cost; The batteries do need to be replaced every three days if the puppy is left on most of the time. We turned it off during the day and got an extra day or two out each set. We usually would wait a night or two before replacing the batteries so that he would get used to there not being a continuous heartbeat. We purchased a lot of 50 batteries (ebay or amazon) for about $13. this lasted a little over 4 months.

Sectioned, detangled, braided in large sections and washed, towel dried and applied section by section w dye brush, put on 2 plastic caps and a knit hat early in the day and left it in for 6-8 hours (just went about my day), rinsed and washed with Just As I Am Coconut Co-wash... hair silk dark and SHINY!!! wow... used a light leave in and did a BnC (Braid Out and Curl) very shiny pretty.

"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige","What seemed like a novel idea, to filter and catch do-do and clumped litter by rolling the whole box, turns out to be a bad idea. The moist portions of the litter cling to the sides and the filter grille, and the clumps won't go into the collection tray. The tray then fills up with unused litter, wasting it. The area available for the cat to actually use is small, even though the box is huge, because the 'working' section takes up over a third of the usable internal space. The fasteners are very flimsy and tricky to use. The side entry makes it awkward to place the unit in a recessed space. In fact, the Omega Paw is more work to use than a traditional litter box. So I have taken the guts out and am using it as a regular box until my replacement, a standard covered box, arrives and I can throw this Omega Paw in the dumpster. A shame I threw my relatively new traditional box away when this thing arrived.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

Roux Fanci Full Rinse #32 Lucky Copper 15 oz,"I have light brown hair with a few blonde highlights and I used the Lucky Copper color on it as per the bottle instructions, applying it to damp hair. Unfortunately, I think because the rinse is not very dark, I couldn't really tell any difference in color. I re-applied it to dry hair (on top of what I had already put on it) and pretty much soaked my hair with it. It gave a very subtle wash of color. Some things to note:1) I could only tell it was kind of redish at the roots and scalp, possibly because it stuck better to my scalp than it did to my hair, otherwise it slightly darkened my hair.2) It has some styling power! I let it air-dry and it had that ""crunchy"" feeling before brushed.3) I did not wear gloves, and it did not stain my hands, but it did get under my nails which was a pain to get rid of.4) It will wear off before washing. I now have a rusty color all over the sweater I wore today and whenever I run my hands through my hair, they end up orange and sticky.5) It may be related to the sheer amount of product I had to use, but it did end up with a horrible but faint smell kind of like chemicals/burnt flesh.6) I have hip-legnth hair and It took about 1/3 of the bottle to coat it all.Overall, I probably won't try to color all of my head again because it dosen't work so well and smells bad. I may just do my top layer of hair or give some streaks into it. It does not drastically change the color of the hair. I think I may try the chocolate brown next to see if that gives more of a change.",beauty,hair care,hair color,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'hair color')"

Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Left Brace with Dorsal Stay,"This is an aesthetically pleasing, well-built, durable product. I have noticed trouble compared to other braces in getting a good fit that applies enough pressure without cutting off circulation. However this has gotten a bit better over time, so I think it's fair to say this brace has a bit of a ""break in"" period.The brace does an excellent job of wicking away moisture, which helps keep bad odor buildup to a minimum.It's important to remember that braces like these are damage control, *not* treatment. Wear it while you sleep; wear it during your most aggravating activities. But make sure you get in plenty of time without a brace like this one. Especially if you developed your wrist issue through repetitive gripping/finger-pushing activities, it is likely that you have issues further up your arm which a brace like this will only mask. Still explore things like massage, nerve/tendon ""flossing"" exercises, and strengthening your extendor muscles. I also recommend Penetrex which you can find for sale here on Amazon.

Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),"Beetlejuice is in my opinion a classic film with not enough Michael Keaton. Although he is the titular character, this story is more about the characters Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and their struggles in dealing with the afterlife. After their early death in the movie, they have to stay in their house for a certain amount of time before they can 'move on' but things go horribly wrong when a modern, city couple and their moody daughter move in.Without spoiling too much, I'll let you know that Beetlejuice still holds up very well today. The story is fun, the effects are a little cheesy but not horrible, and the comedy is almost nonstop. I gave it 4 stars due to the lightning of the film being poor in some areas. I kept hoping someone would bust out a flashlight during the dinner scenes.

My own replacements worked much better. Additionally, replacing the tabs created holes in the stretch fabric to which they attach. So now that part of the diapers is beginning to fail.

Walkfit Orthotic Size A,"I ordered a pair of these about 5 years ago. I have struggled with foot and knee pain since childhood, had bi-lateral release surgery at age 17 (that's both knees), reconstructive surgery on the right at age 21 from torn acl and meniscus, then spent the next 9 years avoiding all my favorite activities like hiking (hills are killer on the knees), hence you found me sitting on my butt watching info-mercials. I told myself it couldn't hurt any more than it already did. I was 30 years old with the arthritis and the lower body joint pain of a 50 year old. Honestly, it took about 3 months for me to feel a difference, but for the first time in 15 years my knees didn't hurt. I went up a flight of stairs and that sharp, knifing pain in my kneecaps was absent; my ankles didn't hurt. Even the lower back pain was receding. By this time I had 2 very small children and was always running after one or the other, but the constant pain in the background was so debilitating. Now at age 35 I still wear these religiously. When I throw on my flip-flops to go walk around somewhere because I'm too lazy to lace up my tennis shoes or pull on my boots, I pay for it within a couple of hours. The knee pain comes right back, so these definitely don't correct the way your feet naturally are...it's an ongoing usage thing. Maybe for people like me who have had out of shape feet their entire lives, it would take longer than just one week for them to readjust all those tiny bones in your foot. I'm trying to correct the problem in my son's feet now, at age 6, he has over-pronation (his ankles bow inward extremely) and he's always complaining of foot pain when he walks. If they made walkfit for children, I'd order him some; had to find another orthotic for him though. Hopefully it will correct the problem now and he won't be dependent on walkfits for the rest of his life. As to the customer service for walkfit.com? I honestly don't remember what I paid, but I'm pretty sure it was within the normal range. If you're not sure, just order from amazon.com.

"Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump, 10-Gallon","This was the first air pump I've used. The most important factor for me was noise, and judging but it's name I figured it would work out. This pump is very quiet but not silent. It has a very mild hum to it but if you put it away from the tank in a cabinet or ever on the floor a few feet away, you can barely hear it. If the bubbles are turned up enough, you can't hear it all. I've noticed that depending on how open or closed the air valve is, the pump will increase in sound slightly. The tighter the valve is closed the louder the pump is. I believe due to back pressure. When it is fully open, the pump is at it's quietest. I have mine in a 10 gal and the full open position is a little too much air pressure for what I wanted. This pump puts out a lot of bubbles, Id say it's more geared for a 20 gal than 10 but turned half way it's perfect for my needs. A slow trickling bubble is what I wanted and you can adjust it to your needs from full bubbled to nearly none. For under $7 you really can't beat it.

Finish Jet Dry Rinse Agent,"First off as a bachelor, I have never used Jet-Dry in the dishwasher. Where I live has very hard water and if the dishes are not removed immediately from the dishwasher and wiped hard water spots will cover the dishes. I decided to test the Jet-Dry on some crusty, un-rinsed dishes that had been in the sink for two weeks due to being out of town, and leave them in the dishwasher overnight. Normally this would require rinsing/scraping before the dishwasher. I put the dishes in on normal wash filled the dishwasher with Jet-Dry (thanks special lady for informing me that you just keep filling the dispenser till its full and check it periodically. Yes, I had to make a call to learn how to use Jet-Dry!). Washing dishes like this would usually leave some form of caked on crusty stuff, and leaving the dishes overnight would leave heavy hard water spots on the dishes/glasses. Much to my surprise, the dishes were spotless upon removal in the morning! There was no crusty food stuck to the plates or silverware, no spots on anything! I am amazed.

"Pirate's Booty Veggie, 4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)","I LOVE Pirate's Booty (the aged white cheddar variety). And recently, I've been trying several varieties of veggie chips, all of which have been pretty good. So when I saw that I could get Pirate's Booty in a veggie variety, I thought, ""Great! Now I can have a super tasty and healthier snack! What could be more perfect?"" and I ordered this 12-pack through subscribe-and-save.I was so excited when it arrived, and immediately broke open a package. It didn't look like I had expected (which was the typical, reddish, greenish, and yellow colors from other brands of veggie chips), and it instead looked like the regular Pirate's Booty puffs covered in a weird greenish powder. It smelled weird, too. ""But hey,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a try. Maybe it tastes good."" So I put one in my mouth. It was so disgusting. It tasted like rancid broccoli. I thought, ""Maybe it's one of those things where you get used to the taste after a couple and then it's good,"" so I tried a few more. No luck. Still gross.I tried giving the rest of my serving to my one-year-old daughter, who also quite likes the regular Pirate's Booty. She ate a couple, and then proceeded to drop the rest on the floor for the dogs to gobble up. I then gave her some Veggie Sticks (also ordered from here, and quite tasty--right in line with what I have come to expect from a veggie chip), and she ate those just fine.When my son came home from kindergarten, I offered him some as a snack. He ate one, and made a face. ""I don't like these, Mommy,"" he said. ""Can I have something else?"" So I gave him some Veggie Sticks, too, which he loves.Last try was my husband. When he came home from work, I asked him to try them. He told me that they tasted like rotten vegetables.The only ones in my house who will eat them are my two dogs, and even they won't eat them if I put them in their dog bowls. The only way they will eat them is if they think they're getting people food, so I have to put them on my daughter's high chair tray and let her toss them on the floor for them to eat.I gave the remaining 11 bags to my son's school's food drive.

philosophy | the oxygen peel | in-home oxygen peel for all skin types,This peel really does a great job on removing dead skin and black heads. I had the peel applied while at the beauty store and just did my first home application. It was an easy 6 step process.1. Mix the gel2. Apply the gel3. Apply the oxygen cream4. Wait 1-3 minutes while the gel and oxygen cream form a foam5. Scrape of the foam (tool is included)6. Clean the residue off your faceFor the week between having the peel done at the store and redoing it at home I noticed that my pores stayed a lot cleaner on my blackhead prone areas and my skin remained blemish free. When I did it my self I also saw the dead skin and grime that the peel was removing after each scrape. So I can see the work the peel does during the process and the effects long after.

However trying to brew it in a drip or stovetop espresso both failed miserably (I reground it to smaller grinds for the stovetop espresso maker). I would not recommend this to anyone. I will try the french press like another reviewer suggested, but this is really the worst tasting coffee you can buy for the money.I'm currently mixing in a little of it with another bean to go through it rather than return it to the store, because I was raving to the clerk at how good Lavazza coffee is when I bought it, I'd be a bit embarrased to return it.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,"('grocery gourmet food', 'beverages', 'coffee')"

Seachem MultiTest Ammonia Test Kit,"This is a must-have complement to an all-in-one kit, such as API's master test kit. Much easier to use than it may first appear-- the most challenging part is handling the sensors, which tend to stick to the metal forceps (static-- wetting the forceps helps). The free ammonia assay is as simple as pipetting 1 mL of sample into a well (label the dish with a permanent Sharpie) and dropping in a sensor. Total ammonia involves one additional step before adding the sensor (add the total ammonia reagent).A properly controlled assay for free and total ammonia requires at least four wells, since you want to control for your conditioned tap water (or whatever source you use). Since each run takes at least 15 minutes, you might as well use wells 5-6 for additional tests (the positive total ammonia control and perhaps a straight/unconditioned tap water test).Once finished, get a small bowl/cup full of clean water and drop the sensors in to rinse them. Then, pick them out and put them back in the container to dry, and they should return to their original yellow color overnight, even if you close the container lid.A few other tips:1. Keep a cup/bowl of clean water close by to rinse your forceps.2. The sensors can be tricky to handle, so place them by the side of the well(s) and use a wooden toothpick to push them in; this ensures the reactions start at essentially the same time.3. Take a picture with the scale, all on a white background with homogeneous lighting. You can then use Image J or Photoshop/similar program to semi-quantitate values, rather than eyeballing them.4. Get a pair of quality forceps. Wiha has many offerings-- makes a huge difference in handling the sensors.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,test kits,"('pet supplies', 'fish aquatic pets', 'test kits')"
Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,"First and foremost, the product arrived later than expected, despite being an Amazon Prime product and 2-day shipping being the selected shipping method.

Then I noticed the tube itself was empty! I looked at the other ones and sure enough, 2 more were empty and the remaining 3 looked very low...as in maybe 1/8 of the tube had any liquid at all!This product is a sham.

Unfortunately, I will never know if a new impeller would have solved the problem. The first one I received came in a smashed box and had two blades cracked off. So, I returned it for a replacement, and received another defective impeller (no blades cracked off, but it had come loose from the plastic box during shipping and bounced around, causing wear and tear, and when placed in my filter, was exponentially louder than it had ever been) due to improper packaging. So, I returned THAT one for a replacement, and the third impeller had one blade cracked off. It's not worth it to keep asking for replacements if they won't improve the packaging. These impellers are delicate and the littlest chip will cause the impeller to rattle in the filter. That said, I do not recommend buying this impeller online.

"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige","We've owned this kitty litter box for quite a few months and so far we love it. We have two cats and this is our only litter box. Previously we had the Budha Dome (sp?), but I didn't like going through so many plastic liners (the cats just tear them up- so wasteful). It's super easy to use and we've had no problems with litter spilling out the sides when rolling it. Definitely makes cleanup a breeze. We make a point to clean it out thoroughly every month or so because sometimes litter gets stuck around the grate, but we're seeing less and less of that as time goes by.For those who say they get a lot of litter stuck on the bottom- we had that problem too, but found a super easy solution that works great. When it's fully rolled over, smack the corners with the palm of your hand pretty hard as though it's got something stuck that you're trying to get to fall. It does a great job of dislodging the pieces that get stuck on the bottom and I haven't had to scoop out litter since figuring that out.You'll want to make sure you're rolling this frequently or you'll end up having to scrape the stuff out by hand which is not something I enjoy doing. Plus, if you don't roll it every day or every other day (and depending on the number of cats using the box) you could end up in a situation where you can't pull the drawer out because it's overflowing, which we'd had happen and it's just not a pretty thing to deal with.Assembly was a breeze- just follow the directions.

The game itself is well balanced and scales well from 2 to 4 players, very nice for when you don't have a large group, and can be played in an hour. While it may not have the player interaction of a settlers or ticket to ride there is stull plenty of fun to be had competing to get the bonus tiles first.

My cat, who previously had been using my chair arm as a scratching post, now happily uses this, which makes me happy to not have destroyed furniture.

"King Ghidorah 9"" Action Figure (Japan Godzilla Import)","If you are shopping for a well-made King Ghidorah toy, you will be very happy with this. Read other reviews and you'll see many happy customers. I count myself among them.If you are collecting the 2005 series of Godzilla figures made by Bandai, be warned. This toy is not from that series. It appears to be made in 1998. While it is the same size as the 2005 series, the quality is not as high. Overall I'm very happy with this King Ghidorah figure. But if you are a collector looking for the much higher quality 2005 series, as I was, you should look elsewhere. This 1998 version looks great from a few feet away, but lacks many of the fine details and careful construction of the 2005 version. (The tail doesn't swivel, the heads don't swivel, some gold paint is missing near the joints, etc.) The 2005 figures are really extraordinary. This 1998 King Ghidorah is very very nice, but not extraordinary.With that said, Ghidorah looks absolutely awesome standing next to my other Godzilla action figures from the 2005 series (Godzilla, Destroyah, Gigan). I am very happy with it, and I think any Godzilla fan will also be satisfied.

"Flying Fox Bat Cuddlekin 12"" by Wild Republic","I'm a bat aficionado who worked with fox bats while interning at a reptile zoo in high school. I'm now in college and decided to get this little guy as a snuggle buddy while slaving away over physics psets.PROS:This bat has large wings, big black eyes and realistic fur and markings. The fur on his body is smooth and not immensely soft, but this is made up for by very soft wings and a large, furry muzzle. In my opinion, he was stuffed perfectly; not bursting at the seams but having substance to him none the less.From an educational perspective, this bat is a great specimen to use in introducing young children to the wonders of bats. He's not ugly or scary in any way (whereas other stuffed bats, such as Wild Republic's vampire bats, look realistic and therefore might be less likable to people who don't already appreciate bats). He has a face like a dog's or bear's, which children can latch on to and identify with.Overall, I think Wild Republic did a good job representing this animal in stuffed form, great for educational and personal uses alike!CON:I purchased him at $18.09 after having had him in my cart for two weeks and one day after purchase he dropped in price to $11.43. In my opinion, that was in poor taste of the seller although it may have just been bad luck on my part.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures,"('toys games', 'stuffed animals plush', 'animals figures')"

"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary","Our turbo scratcher gets more than daily use in this multi-cat home-Turbo Scratcher has been a fixture here for more than 7 years and is the most-used cat toy we own. As cats love novelty and were bored with the single ball that comes in the track, I added 2 balls of the same diameter and differing weights-ours contains the original ball, a golf ball, and a sturdy lightweight plastic ball (clear ones with spinners are great for this). Using 3 balls of differing weights and premium catnip makes Turbo Scratcher irresistible. When kitties paw at any ball in the track, that ball sets the others in motion-which send the others in opposite directions moving at different speeds according to their weights. Action continues for well over a minute-cats stay fascinated and keep playing! Add a couple tablespoons premium catnip at least twice a week-or add a couple teaspoons weekly. My cats have many toys-Turbo Scratcher gets the most use. With frequent use the cardboard insert breaks down over time-I buy the refill packs and replace them once or twice a year. Inserts can be recycled and repurposed-using a bread knife and cutting board, reduce the catnip infused cardboard down to 1.5 inch cubes-insert catnip and cubes deep into missing-mate socks-tie a single knot in the center-voila!

Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,"I'm an avid backpacker and camper. When I learned about this soap, I was excited about all the uses it claims to have, and wanted to try it. So I ordered the tea tree oil version since I've heard tea tree oil can be an antiseptic, and it's nice having that when cleaning out wounds. I took about three ounces on a four day camping trip, and had about 3/4 of the bottle remaining. I used it for everything I could think of:1) Body wash and Shampoo - The soap left my skin and hair clean, and left a faint, earthy scent.2) Toothpaste - It cleaned my teeth and removed my bad breath, but it was still soap and I was tasting that earthy scent for a little while afterward.

Toysmith Zen Garden,"When my students approach my desk, they inevitably want to touch and play with the things on it, which sometimes is a problem. This Zen Garden was my solution to this problem. Its so predictable and sweet; a student will stand at my desk, pick up the little rake and start drawing in the sand and say to me, ""Miss, what's this thing for?"" I always smile and reply, ""Just what you are doing right now."" A few have made me laugh as they continue to draw and design in the sand and say, ""Well that's dumb."" To which I reply, ""You're STILL doing it, aren't you?"" :-)I think there is something primal about playing with sand and it has brought joy to my classroom - to my students who now have a little toy and to me because they now have something they should be touching on my desk, and of course the smiles they give me when they do play with it!Is this the best one out there? No, not really. It is a little cheap. One of the legs came off, but I glued it back on. Also, its not very deep, I have to keep the whole thing in the tray that it came it to prevent sand spillage all over my desk - fortunately the box it came in has a nice black cardboard tray that doesn't detract from its appearance. This bottom is also helpful because the wooden garden itself isn't 100% level. The sand is very fine, so it leaves a powder residue around the frame - I use a small make up brush to brush this sand back into the garden.So, no it is not the best one out there, but it does do what its supposed to do and between the rocks and two garden tools it comes with (which have held up well so far - 3 months of use), it is a nice starter set at a decent price. Also, the book that contains the meditations is lovely and a nice part of the set.I had some pretty tumbled rocks I had from when I taught science and replaced the plain brown ones with them and it looks great.",toys games,arts crafts,craft kits,"('toys games', 'arts crafts', 'craft kits')"

Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple,"This is a pretty basic, no-frills nipple. It fits in the caps on the Gerber BPA free bottles, as well as those rings that come with the tiny disposable formula bottles you get at the hospital or from the doctor. It is x-cut so the flow is pretty quick; however, we needed something with a larger hole because my son would not suck long when he had an ear infection. He was not getting enough calories so the doctor (off the record) recommended putting a bit of rice in the bottle with the breastmilk to boost his calorie intake and to get him to take more ounces in a shorter period of time. His other nipples were clogging- typically he takes a medium flow at 21 weeks old. This is the perfect flow for getting him thicker fluids. The medium is best for just breastmilk at this age. Also, we have used MAM, Born Free, Milkbank, and Dr. Browns with all of our kids and the Evenflo, as well as the similar Gerber style, is his favorite.",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,"('baby products', 'feeding', 'bottle feeding')"

Even if you are not active or sports, it is very important to provide your body with high quiality proteins and supplements. By giving to your body this way it goes right to where it is needed. Don't be surprized to see results in as little as two weeks. My finger nails had started getting thin, brittle, cracking and was had a real concern. I thought about going to the doctor about. The the light bulb flashed and remembered my body building days. With in two weeks may finger nails were back to normal. Some of my wrinkles smooth out and hair got thicker. My joints moved better.

Pampers Swaddlers,"As new parents we didn't know what diapers to use. We received many diaper brands including Pampers with our baby shower. However, the Swaddlers were the best out of all of them. When we were trying to use the other brands, our daughter's skin got irritated causing the top layer to peel off. That ended up in a trip to the doctor. We then switched back to the Swaddlers and haven't had an issue. The yellow strip has been useful to us as well. Initially our daughter would cry everytime she had a wet diaper, however, when she was smaller, we would not have been able to tell that she had a wet diaper had it not been for the ""code blue"" strip. Yes we went through a ton of diapers, but it saved us lots of headaches because she would always stop crying after her diaper had been changed. Now she is older, and you can tell without the ""code blue strip"", but in the beginning it was a life saver.

However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet. It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).As a top coat, this product is the worst. I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails. Hours after using it, I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it.

Quickie Original Flexible Static Duster,"I am the owner of a cleaning business. We use ONLY these types of dusters for high areas. We go through a ton of them every year. It has a been a true hassle trying to find these. All stores including Wal Mart and Target have stopped selling these types. The wool ones that EVERY one seems to have are useless to us. They mat up and become extremely dirty. These static dusters are the BEST product. They collect cobwebs and dust in areas we cannot reach. When they start to get dirty all we have to do is vacuum them off and it's like new.We love these dusters. The only complaint I do have and the only reason that we go through so many is the fact they after using them ALL day EVERY day, the wire gets weak and ends up breaking the duster in half. Remember we are a cleaning business. No product is designed to be used the way we use them. So for the average home owner I'm sure they would last a lifetime.Please do not stop selling these. Thank you for being almost the ONLY ones that carry them. It's getting harder and harder to find these.

"NorthShore Premium Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Large Size 23 x 36, Pk/25","I ordered these because someone on the review page warned me away from another distributor (thank you sir) they arrived very fast and when I opened the box I knew I had one problem solved. I use them for a Chinese Crested who doesn't understand why he has to go outside in the freezing cold, rain, wind, or he doesn't feel like it. So pooping is fine just outside the door, but peeing is best if done in the house. On these pads. There's room for Mr. 9 pounds of terror so that he doesn't get his feet smelly (this is the same dog who runs to the bathroom after coming in from outside because he doesn't feel ""fresh"" to be cleaned. Just in case.) So these pads are a joy. The padding is absorbent and even (no gaping holes and empty spots) They don't carry urine to be siphoned onto the floor and the size 23 X 36 is perfect. I wouldn't change companies for anything. NorthShore has my vote all the way.",health personal care,health care,incontinence,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'incontinence')"

glominerals glominerals gloPressed Base -.35 fl oz,"I love glominerals makeup but I'm not sure what's up with some products that come from unapproved vendors. Of course, glominerals warns the public against ordering from unauthorized places, for various reasons that you can look on their website, but I took a chance because I was in a bind and needed some quickly (thanks Amazon for that). With this specific experience, after the third day, I opened the compact to see that all the pressed base was a crumbly mess. Fortunately, I had a backup mineral foundation container that I was able to pour it all in to. Whew! Lost a little in the process but at least it wasn't a total loss.

I was sure it was the result of damage in shipping so I sent it back and immediately ordered another one.Second Fountain comes and no leaks. I'm happy my cats are happy, all is well...not so fast. It's been a couple of weeks and yesterday I found it was leaking, badly. This time I wasn't checking it so I have some floor damage, fortunately not very much and that's not really the issue for me. I'm sending back the unit but now my cats do not have a fountain. I have some unhappy little furs.

The only thing that has helped with the incessant razor bumps under my arms has been laser hair removal. Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer so I don't even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine.

I held it up to show friends, before showing it to the puppy dog, but he was already dancing and jumping because he somehow knew it was HIS. I put it on him and he just pranced all around thrilled to be wearing it.I have washed it many times inside a laundry mesh bag so the velcro doesn't tangle with other clothes. It still looks beautiful. Most days my little pooch has to wear a sweater in the winter, so when it's time to go for our walks, I pop on his coat and he is THRILLED!Everyone comments on the coat, because it is nice looking and not goofy at all. I am so sick and tired of the goofy stuff they make for dogs, I want my doggy to be warm and look nice. He seriously needs the warmth around his heart and lungs. You may need to use it over a sweater too, as the velcro tabs may not cover enough of the dogs heart and lungs.Thank goodness they included a slit in the shoulders for his harness, as it definitely looks cuter with the harness underneath and not on top. I have so many cute pictures of my dog wearing this. Just picking it up, send him dancing and jumping for joy, then he stands real still while I put it on him.

Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,"My dog wore this all last winter and now he is wearing it this winter too. I wish it were longer. It's silly that they give the length of the coat and not the width. I wish his were longer down his back, but still he loves it.The coat arrived on a tiny hanger. I held it up to show friends, before showing it to the puppy dog, but he was already dancing and jumping because he somehow knew it was HIS. I put it on him and he just pranced all around thrilled to be wearing it.I have washed it many times inside a laundry mesh bag so the velcro doesn't tangle with other clothes. It still looks beautiful. Most days my little pooch has to wear a sweater in the winter, so when it's time to go for our walks, I pop on his coat and he is THRILLED!Everyone comments on the coat, because it is nice looking and not goofy at all. I am so sick and tired of the goofy stuff they make for dogs, I want my doggy to be warm and look nice. He seriously needs the warmth around his heart and lungs. You may need to use it over a sweater too, as the velcro tabs may not cover enough of the dogs heart and lungs.Thank goodness they included a slit in the shoulders for his harness, as it definitely looks cuter with the harness underneath and not on top. I have so many cute pictures of my dog wearing this. Just picking it up, send him dancing and jumping for joy, then he stands real still while I put it on him. Sometimes when we come back home, he runs off with his coat still on, not wanting me to take it off at all, even though I have the heat turned up for him.",pet supplies,dogs,apparel accessories,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'apparel accessories')"

Aquolina Pink Sugar,"(this is for the Hair Pefume)smelled this scent in Sephora months ago and loved it, but I couldn't afford it at the time, so I forgot about it. Then I found it on Amazon and was shocked at how much cheaper it was. I purchased it, and the shipping was fast and the packaging was secure. However, I am pretty sure this is the old version of the product.For one thing, the smell is very, very faint. It smells nice, but I can hardly smell it right after spraying, and I can't smell it at all after the first minute. I thought maybe my nose was just not working, so I asked several friends and family if they could smell it, and they said they couldn't smell it either. Even when I used a ton of sprays and even resorted to spraying it on my clothes, it simply didn't last. The one I tried out in Sephora was strong and lasted quite a while.The scent issue wouldn't have been so bad if this stuff actually did anything for my hair as it claims it does, but it doesn't do anything. It didn't tame my fly aways or frizz or make it look shiny.I don't like leaving negative feedback and I definitely don't like accusing people easily, so I don't make this claim lightly. I spent hours researching. I went to the official website of Aquolina and on their facebook page and the bottle they show looks completely different from mine. I went to several different websites, including Sephora, and again, the bottle looks completely different from this one.I am very upset at this, I loved this stuff when I first smelled it and was looking forward to wearing it every day. :(",beauty,fragrance,women s,"('beauty', 'fragrance', 'women s')"

Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,"I bought this toy for my grandson to play with while at my house. At 8 months he didn't do anything with it at all... I took the lid off and he did throw a few shapes into the open bucket. If you are worried about any chemicals, this would not be the age to give it to your child. I am not too concerned about that, as he really hasn't put the pieces in his mouth much.Now, at almost 14 months, my grandson is just starting to try to fit the shapes through the holes in the lid. The lid does not snap on.. and doesn't stay on well if the child knocks the toy around at all... however, it sure isn't a problem for him to take the lid off of the bucket when he wants to! I believe later on he may like to carry the bucket around with toys in it.. So, I think we will get a lot of use out of this toy. Definitely worth the money.",toys games,baby toddler toys,blocks,"('toys games', 'baby toddler toys', 'blocks')"

Mardel Freshwater CopperSafe,"I have a small tank (5-1/2 gallon) with 4 fancy guppies and 2 cory catfish. One of the catfish developed white spots and red streaks, appeared to have balance problems & stopped eating, while all of the other fish seemed to remain healthy. I am new at keeping fish, and admit I have no idea exactly what was affecting this catfish. I removed him to a hospital tank and dosed him with a different product which clearly hurt rather than helped. I returned him to the main tank and dosed it with a combination of Mardel Coppersafe and Maracyn Two. This caused no adverse reaction from any of the fish, and the ailing catfish began to look better. After five days of the combination meds, the catfish has no signs of distress and the spots and red streaks have completely disappeared. I hadn't thought he would survive, but he is now busily searching for food and he looks healthy. I will continue treatment with Coppersafe for a total of 30 days to be sure there are no more infestations in the tank or filter. Coppersafe does not die the water blue nor does it stain the tank. Mardel Customer Service was easy to reach and very helpful when I had questions about their products. Coppersafe used with Maracyn Two treats a wide spectrum of problems and certainly worked well for me.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,water treatments,"('pet supplies', 'fish aquatic pets', 'water treatments')"

It's a plush toy made with a variety of different feeling textiles, has a croaking sound when you flip the frog upside down, has one hand that squeeks and another that rattles. It has a little mirror on his belly, a pouch with a flower that babies can take in and out or teeth on as well as a crinkly sounding dragonfly attached to it, numbers on the fingers, a pull cord vibrating tongue, and it's really bright and fun.

Vademecum mouthwash and gargle concentrate - 2.5 oz,"I have been using Vedemecum for a very long time and I have to say this is a very good mouthwash at least far better than those Listerine or other products available in the US market. It doesn't have alcohol nor make me feel like I have to brush my teeth again because of that sweet yucky after taste Listerine or other mouthwash products have. The problem I have is the seller, Medideals. At the time I placed an order, there was nothing indicating that it could take Medideal anywhere from 30 to 45 days to deliver these products to me. Once I found out that my order will only be delivered to me any time during Nov 30 to Dec 13 (I placed this order on Oct 31), I called Amazon's customer services department and indicated to them that I no longer want these products. Who would want to wait for 45 days just to get two bottles of mouthwash???? Well, definitely not me for sure. Unfortunately, they already shipped my order and here is the catch!!!! I later found out that they are located in U.K., hence the reason why it takes them so long to deliver my order. None of the information as to how long it takes to deliver the products nor the location of the vendor has been made clear to me at the time of purchase. Had I known, I would not have placed an order with this seller. So, BUYER BEWARE, if you are not in UK like me (I live in US) and have a problem with the products and/or vendor services, you are on your own!!!! Well, you can pretty much kiss good bye to the return policy. Shipping the product back from U.S. to U.K. probably cost more than the product itself. I am just wondering why they would even bother having the return policy. Amazon should have made it clear where their 3rd party vendors are located so we, as a customer, can decide whether we want to buy products from overseas sellers. As of now, I am still waiting to see whether I will ever get the products I ordered. Overall, it is just a very bad experience. I gave them the lowest rating allowed but, in fact, I would rather give them zero or lower!!!!

Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,"I put Frontline on my bichons in September, and noticed that they still were getting flea dirt. I applied again in October before I left for a two week vacation. When I returned home, the dogs, who were being cared for in my home by my neighbor, were so infested with fleas, they had begun having a horrible allergic reaction to them. They completely ripped the hair off their tails and left a bloody, scabbing mess. Their hind ends were also a bloody matted mess. After a prescription flea treatment, antibiotics, steroids, and the ""cone of shame"", they are finally on the road to recovery. But no thanks to Frontline. It is useless. You might as well treat your dogs with water. And I just purchased a brand new, unopened package of Frontline from Amazon. When I looked into returning, I discovered that I cannot return the product because Amazon considers it a hazardous material. Huh? VERY DISAPPOINTED in Frontline AND Amazon.

Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat,"Overall this does the job, but it's not perfect.Pros:1. Good size2. Easy to cleanCons:1. Suction cups don't stick well to our wooden table2.

Our daughter does try to fold it up and pull it off the table, but at least 3 of the suction cups work relatively well so she can't get it completely off and I'd rather deal with that than whole dishes of food hitting the floor.

Schleich Smurfs Large House,"First of all, my kids (2 and 5) do like this. We have a small village, with this big house, two smaller ones, and lots of Smurfs. The figurines get played with almost daily. The houses get pulled out less often. This one in particular is top heavy. The roof just does not stay put, and while it's notched to show how to orient it to put it back on, the odd shape means it's tough to balance, especially for a little kid. The shape of the base is also a bit frustrating, since it is narrower at the top. Even with the top off, and even with little hands, playing in there is just a bit cumbersome and tight. Also, while it is roomy for a Smurf or two, no accessories can fit in there, so what is Papa Smurf to do? He goes in, he comes out, but that's about it. The key and locking door is a nice touch, though, so when he goes out foraging for berries he can be sure Jokey will not come trouble his mushroom. So, would I buy it again? For over $30, no. It's great for setting the scene, but that can be done with the smaller houses, which are half the cost of this one. If you do get it (it is so darn cute, though!) BE SURE TO GLUE ALL THE EXTRAS ON. Really. They snap in okay, but they do not stay put, and alas, we have lost some parts. What Schleich should have done IMHO (and I do love their products, generally) was make the mushrooms in one piece with an open back for access. That would have made them really playable. Again, this does get some use with my kids, certainly if you are a collector go for it just for aesthetics. Since we have it I'm sure we will have it forever...

In order to confirm my suspicions, I went and retrieved an old container which I purchased from Sephora, so I knew it was legit. Sure enough the imitation was the same in appearance, but the major difference was that the fact that there was no batch # on the imitation (There was one on the good container) and the font on the bottom label is different.Buyers Beware as there is no telling how this makeup is composed and that in itself is scary!",beauty,makeup,face,"('beauty', 'makeup', 'face')"

Baby's My First Photo Album of Family & Friends,"I bought this album for my newest niece after seeing it at my friend's house. It's a great little album. I printed pictures of the family (near and far). She's 5 months old and likes looking at it, chewing it, and drooling on it. However, I am confident the pictures will be amusing later.She has two older sisters - 20 months and 3 years. The 20 month old points to the pictures, practicing her nouns (mommy, daddy, etc). She loves to look through every page over and over and studies the pictures and brings the book back over and over. She especially loves the ones she is in.The three year old loves to make up stories about each picture of her family. She tells about Auntie's last visit or the day they went to the park and took the pictures in the fallen leaves. She ""reads"" the stories to her sisters and they all enjoy it.All in all, this is a delight! It's sturdy construction makes it durable, droolable, and perfect. Each page is two clear plastic sheets sewn with fabric around the edges, so the drool doesn't reach the pictures (yet). It's not heavy enough to hurt when the baby swings it in someone face or anything, either. It was a PERFECT gift. I just need two more for the older girls now!I've also seen this book in a church nursery where the ""regulars"" and workers were featured throughout the books (there were several).

JW Pet Hol-ee Roller Dog Toy,"I have a 1 year old dachshund/lab/shepherd (only know the weenie for sure) pup that loves to chew on toys that have a little give. For instance, he's not a huge fan of the Nylabones durachews cause they're so tough; I think he likes to feel like he's getting something out of chewing. He kind of likes Kongs, but not that much, unless they have peanut butter in them.A lot of people wrote about how durable this thing was, but in my experience, it's not at all. After about 10 minutes with it, he'd already chewed through a piece of it, so I took it away from him.

Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,I bought this for my husband in 2010. He wears a mustache and goatie. His facial hair is very thick and this trimmer is perfect!

Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,"Do not buy any Holiday Train Set made by Lionel. Period! I bought the Holiday Tradition Express set four years ago and it worked fine under the tree until this year. Now the thing does not work. I spoke to Lionel customer service and guess what - the set has been discontinued with no spare parts available. The service centers do not work on them. No refunds, no parts, no luck. It cannot be fixed, so now I have a nice paperweight that looks like a train. The kids are soooo disappointed this year. How can an American icon make such cheap stuff and be such rip off artists?!?! I mean the run time on my set was maybe 20 - 30 times over the last four years just at Christmas time, and now the thing does not work with no way to fix it. However cute the set looks, only purchase it if you want to ultimately waste your money! The irony here is that this supposed icon in model trains makes complete junk while another ""no name"" holiday train set I have has worked great for 20 years running.

Perfect Pet Tubby Kat Cat Door with 4 Way Lock And LEXAN Flap,"I needed this for an indoor application to allow my cats to get to the basement for the litter box and food.

My other cat is much smaller so I needed to be able to mount this at a height that was a compromise for them. Very easy to mount and looks great installed on my basement door.The only negative is my cats hated the hard plastic flap. I read several reviews about letting them get used to it, but after a day I just removed the flap and all is well. Now that they are using it I thought about putting the flap back on but have decided since it is an indoor application to just leave it as is.I did buy a second one as I have basement refinishing happening and will need another access point.

OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack,"I wanted to try another brand of wipes, and I'm not 100% pleased with these. I'll admit, I was lured by the price (I bought them on another site for a better price than Amazon). They are very thin and shrink considerably during the first laundering. They tend to stick to the diaper pieces in the dryer and don't spread out/open easily once placed in the diaper wipe solution and wrung out. I wind up trying to use two hands, but anyone with small children knows that won't work. So, I wind up trying to shake the wipe open with one hand - and I get drips of solution everywhere. On the positive side, they are soft, and do the job. I haven't owned them long enough to figure out if they fray or not. Once they do, I'll probably toss them.

The product was a dud and I wrote a deservedly-bad evaluation on their web site. But the product gave me an idea.

Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,"New neighbors with two untrained dogs moved in next door, spoiling the quiet neighborhood. I was skeptical of this device, but mounted it under the overhang facing over the wooden fence separating our properties. I ran the cord to an electrical outlet, so the device is always on. The first time after installation, the dogs set to barking, the device went off in the inaudible mode, and the dogs ceased barking and ran around the neighbor's pool, obviously confused. After three weeks of using the device, when the dogs come out to the pool area, they give a couple of woofs, and then shut up. A consideration is that the low-flying planes that skim my rooftop going into the air force base two miles away set the device off - audible screech - but as soon as the planes pass, the screeching stops. The lawn man's riding lawn mower sets the device off to audible, so I have to unplug it when he is here. Chain saws also set off the device, as I discovered when the tree men removed a downed tree after Hurricane Sandy. The audible screeching is not intolerable to human - not like ice picks in the eyes - and after the offending planes, mowers, and chain saws leave, the device goes back to inaudible without any effort on my part.

Store the bags properly, and be sure to grind only as much as you're going to use at once. Grind it fresh. Use a thoroughly cleaned coffeemaker. Use fresh, ice cold water.

Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,"I cannot believe it, but it actually works!!!! We have a terrier that barks at anything. A leaf on the porch that was not there five minutes ago will cause a fury of barking. Our neighbors new Christmas lights, more barking. He cannot help it. He is a terrier and he is our baby. His job is to tell us when something is different and he is really good at his job. One thing that is embarrassing is that he is so good at his job that when anyone rings the doorbell, he races to the door, barking at the top of his lungs, sounding as if he wants to eat someone up. They don't see his tail wagging and he is just so excited that someone has come to see him that he is beside himself. This is fine if it is strangers, but with friends, not so much. It is also embarrassing when repair people come to do something in our house. We got this collar because I had tried the clicker method, spraying him with water, speaking firmly, putting a thunder shirt on him. Nothing worked. I would not put a shock collar on him because, as I said, he is our baby and I am not going to hurt him. I got this citronella collar and put it on him right before my husband's best friend came over. It was a good test because my husband's friend always causes our dog to bark his head off. Our friend rang the door bell, our dog ran to the door yelling, was sprayed and stopped barking. He barked again, was sprayed again, and stopped barking. And he STOPPED barking !!!!! He would forget once in a while and would bark, get sprayed, and would quiet himself. I only use it on him when I know someone is coming over, such as a repairman or a friend. I like for him to bark when I don't know the person at my door or when I am not expecting anyone. He is, after all, just doing his job that he was born to do, bark to alert us. I highly recommend this as a way to control your dog's barking during those times when you really don't want him to bark. He has learned that he can just do a little puff bark and it does not cause a spray. That is ok. I highly recommend it and hope that it works as well on your dog as it does on ours.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'collars')"

My parents have a puzzle from the 80's where the area for each letter is deeper so the pieces don't come out as easily. but i am overall very happy with my purchase. the colors are very vibrant, the actual puzzle itself is made very well. I just wish that where you put each letter could be somewhat deeper. the letters do stay put even when the puzzle is standing upright so don't get me wrong, it's not like the puzzle is poorly made- the pieces do stay there. it's more of a personal preference. great puzzle! :)",toys games,puzzles,jigsaw puzzles,"('toys games', 'puzzles', 'jigsaw puzzles')"

Brewers Yeast Tablets with Garlic,"I have been struggling for years trying to find a good flea product. I started with frontline until I realized that I was giving my pets neurotoxins that have been proven to cause seizures, especially in cats (yikes). Then I moved on to Program and Capstar. Program didn't seem to do all that much, and Capstar, yet again, another insecticide (yikes again). I tried all kinds of all natural herbal sprays (didn't work worth a damn) and read about every possibility, until I came upon this brewer's yeast and garlic idea. I knew that brewer's yeast was good for the skin, but didn't realize that a healthy coat actually keeps fleas away. I didn't have high hopes since I had little luck with natural flea medicine in the past, but it was cheap so I thought I'd give it a try. Well let me say, my dog and cat LOVED the pills and devoured them whole. My cat almost mauled me the first time I opened the bottle, which certainly beats shoving a capstar down her throat. Within a couple days, I already noticed a difference in my dog. He has flea dermititis and previously had little red bumps all over his stomach and a bald scabbed patch of skin at the base of his tail. Literally within two or three days the red bumps were gone and the patch of hair started growing back. They've been taking them daily for a couple weeks now and no more fleas. Haven't seen one since they started taking it. I was slightly concerned about the garlic content since I know that onion and garlic are not good for animals. However, I did more research and discovered that the studies conducted that discovered garlic to cause anemia in dogs used EXTREMELY high quantities of garlic, 60 GRAMS a day! I emailed the company with my concern, and they responded within a couple days saying that their tabs contain 1.9 MILLIGRAMS of garlic per tab. That's nothing compared to this study. This small amount is perfectly safe. So the product is inexpensive (yay), safe (double yay) and effective (triple yay!!)

Use an exacto knife to cut the tracing out, and rest the fan on the lid pointing toward the ceiling. The power cord will go in the bucket and come out one of the holes you drilled.Remember, the more holes you drill the more airflow you'll get, but once you drill a hole you can't undrill it!On the bucket bottom, just pour in the entire bag of crystals, and a water diluted solution of this ONA concentrate.

When my contractions started I didn't even know I was in labor. The contractions felt like very strong menstrual cramps and were not near as bad as I had anticipated. I was in labor 8 hours and pushed for about 30 minutes. My labor pains were mild and I was able to sit and let my body relax through the contractions.

Unger 92134 36-Inch Nifty Nabber Pick-Up Tool with Aluminum Handle,"This tool is sturdy and picks up coins off the floor. In comparison, the Gopher does not pick up coins or other flat objects (except paper that will crumple). But the Gopher is much lighter weight and easier to use (because the handle is perpedicular to the rod, which is not the case with the Nifty Nabber). And the Gopher can grab a can such as a standard tuna can, which the Nabber cannot because of the shape of the grabber part. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Gopher doesn't last very long before the screw threads that retain the rubber grabber parts become completely stripped. For people with lower back problems, it is useful to have both tools, as they complement each other. The trick, I guess, is to use the Gopher sparingly. We'll see how long the Nifty Nabber lasts.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,daily living aids,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'daily living aids')"
Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,"One of my cats loves drinking running water straight out of the faucet. So much so that she doesn't always drink enough water if she has to deign to drink from a bowl like her sister. The vet suggested just leaving a faucet running. In the interest of environmental consciousness I thought this might be a better plan. Turns out one of my cats is terrified of the noise (its barely noisy she is just a scaredy cat), so I still have to use a regular bowl.The part I hate most is the cleaning. With the bowl I pick it up clean it out with a soapy sponge, rinse, refill and am done. With this I don't have a place super close to my sink so I usually remove the reservoir and the little lid that constantly falls off anyway and then carry the whole thing over. Unfortunately I am not talented enough to do this without spilling. Once I get it to the sink it breaks out into four more additional pieces plus the pump. Each piece has to be individually washed and rinsed and there are still a few nooks and crannies that I never feel like I can get clean. It a lot of time every weekend to spend cleaning a cat fountain.I have now replaced this with a different brand that has just the bottom piece the bowl and a pump. Its definitely less fancy and with no reservoir requires more fillings but its much easier and less time consuming to keep clean.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'feeding watering supplies')"

"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack","The big claim for these 'digital' batteries is that they are more carefully made than others so that they can deliver peak power over a longer period than 'regular' alkaline batteries. I checked out the Panasonic company site and the product specifications do not make any claims for hours of use...nor could they, since temperature and drain play such a great role in battery life. They do claim a longer shelf life and note that these batteries contain (I think 8) patent-worthy improvements over other alkaline batteries. Panasonic is a solid brand so I am inclined to accept their word for it. The package art suggests one use for these AA batteries is in battery powered toys or radio controlled models, applications with a high rate of drain on a stored charge. These batteries should extend play time or allow for longer use in flashlight devices that use 1.5 v. cylindrical batteries. My wife has a digital camera that takes these cylindrical batteries and they should increase the number of flash pictures that can be taken in comparison with 'lesser' 1.5 v. alkaline batteries.

We decided against the loud manufactured tones and tried a few that we recorded on our own. We were happy that we had this option. You can adjust the volume easily so that could be adjusted, too.We didn't have any problem with the pad sensing moisture and NOT sensing sweat. It took a few trials the first couple of nights to make sure that the layers of sheets on top of the pad were just right. If you only use one thin layer, the plastic pad is not comfortable to sleep on and since it is plastic, will cause sweating. I presume that is the problem that the others comment about.

Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover,"We have a 15 year old male cat who has arthritis so has difficulty walking. For this reason we removed the hard plastic litter pad for a softer and much larger piece of carpet runner under the litter box. Well about a week ago, he pee'd on the carpet pad. The stain was about 10"" around. I removed the pad and sprayed the pad till soaked and let it sit for about 10 minutes then I hosed it off with water outside and let it dry. Well the pad still smelled! Now I had used this product about two weeks prior on a smaller spot and it worked so I couldn't understand why this time it didn't! So again I sprayed the carpet piece till soaked and let it sit for about 45 minutes. I got two clean old towels, folded one and placed it under the carpet piece. Then folded the second towel and placed it on top of the carpet, then I rolled the whole thing and pressed down on the rolled to try and get out as much moisture as possible. I let it dry overnight and the next day, NO smell! I don't know if my trying to rinse it off with water made it ineffective or what, but I'm glad I didn't give up!I don't understand why it doesn't work for some people. Weird! Could it be something they are doing OR are not doing? One review stated that the name was sold to another company but not the formula. I don't know anything about that but I do know that this exact product does work. My original bottle was purchased in late October from Petco and it worked on several small spots.

Petstages Cheese Chase Ball Track for Cat Toy,"Any cat caretaker knows that their pleasure is much more important than any mere human's. I am here to type a review on behalf of my cats. They offered to post a review themselves, but I gently explained to them that most Amazon customers simply are not sophisticated enough to translate lines of &#34;apjo 9uig -s0df-&#34; into something comprehensible to our small and insignificant brains... and so if they would please allow me to convert their melodious &#34;meows&#34; into the crass language of humans, I was certain that many other feline overlords would definitely be on the receiving end of this Ball Track. After further mentioning that they should not wear themselves out with the onerous exertion of typing, they agreed.My furry keepers have advised that dipping the mouse topper of this Ball Track into catnip (Yeoww! brand preferred) is a requirement for their ongoing pleasure. They have also said that they very much enjoy the minor challenge (VERY minor, my one cat assures) of fitting their paws between the top and bottom of this Ball Track so as to send the outer ball spinning around the toy. They appreciate the contrast between this and their other ball track toy, because the other presents no challenge to pushing the ball with their noses instead - should they deign to do so out of sight of human beings.They have also offered a bit of a warning to their front-clawed comrades (I'll note that we did NOT remove their claws - both of my feline overlords are rescues who came to us that way)... they worry that a clawed comrade might find him or herself catching their claws on the somewhat narrow center holes of the Ball Track when trying to bat the inner ball around. They suggest that human caretakers watch to see if this is an issue for their furred masters.My Lady and Lord have allowed that I may indulge in a very small piece of cheesecake this evening as a reward for purchasing this bit of entertainment for them... of course, the bulk of that small piece is first to be given to them as tribute, but I am grateful for receiving any treat at all, knowing how unworthy I am of such charity.",pet supplies,cats,toys,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'toys')"

Body Back Buddy & Mini-BBB Self Massage Tool Duo,"The big S shaped device is good for getting to some places on the back, but the knobs are often too small and hard (ouch). I wish they offered little balls that could be fitted over the knobs. I guess I'll have to retrofit them myself. I had one of these type things years ago, and it was the same problem. I put a tennis ball over the knobs and it was great. So, it still gets 4 stars because it's a good contraption for the purpose.The little hand-hook, which hitchhiked with my order of the big S, is a disappointment. The knob has a gnarl on the end that is just not right. I might file that gnarly thing off, which would make it more practical. It's not good for much of anything except someone with a tiny waist. However, I do think it will be useful for the neck area, once I file off that gnarl or fit it with a ball.So, I took off a star because of the above issues, which are relatively insignificant.

"BSN NO-Xplode, Lemon Lime, 2.48 Pound","This has got to be my absolute FAVORITE pre-workout supplement. I have used this product for years now and I absolutely love it. I was a huge fan of the original NO-XPLODE and just when I think they couldn't get a better concoction together they come out with the advanced strength. The advanced strength has some of the same benefits of the original mixture but they added Beta Alanine. I assume they saw the popularity of the pre-workout supplement Jack 3-d and wanted to capitalize on it. What you have is a new and improved supplement that get's you ready for the work out of your life. For every &#34;study&#34; out there that says one good thing about a supplement like NO-XPLODE I could find 3 others that say something negative. All I know is I get a stronger pump, a harder work out, and a better all around feeling when I use it so I will let the science guys continue the debate while I use this great product. I do caution that once you finished your 2.48 container you should take the same amount of time you were on it and take a break from it. I also caution you to not worry about the tingling you will feel after you take it. That's just the Beta Alanine kicking in and it's nothing to worry about!

I tried to use the Windex on my car windshield, but after trying 6 (YES 6) times with Windex - it only smeared the grime around, I found a battle of Dirtex on my boat with a tiny amount left and it was enough to spray on the driver side and I could clear enough of the grime of Windex to see through. That was it, I headed right to the internet and ordered more Dirtex. I don't know why Savogran does not expand on this product - it out does Windex by a factor of 100.

I love that the ingredients are included in the single pack, instead of having to purchase oil and popcorn separately. I did add Flavacol and Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping as well to get even closer to that movie theater taste.I cook mine in a Whirley Pop and it works well. I think to get true movie theater flavor you have to cook it in a true popcorn popper with the kettle that dumps the popcorn right after popping it. I think that on the stove you lose some flavor as the popcorn stays in the kettle and is subject to additional heat and moisture after it pops.All in all the packaging is nice and easy to use. I just wish they had an easier tear option at the top. Usually I cut open the oil side with scissors and dump it in the Whirley Pop first to melt it. Then I cut open the remainder of the package and dump the contents in when the temp is good. Generally I get a consistent batch, but every now and then I get a batch that is either too crunchy or a little too sticky.

Goldwell Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo (select option/size),"First of all, I love to use Goldwell Ultra Rich Conditioner to treat my hair.

Normally, after 2-3 treatment, my hair has a shiny healthy look.

My previous 1 liter bottle last a very very long time.

The conditioner came out very watery and it doesn't have the magic effect on my hair any more.

Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine Powder,"We have been using glutamine powder for several years for several reasons. Glutamine helps rebuild the lining of the gastrointestinal system; spending tons on probiotics without taking this is literally wasted money. It also is good for building muscle. It also is necessary in the production of glutathione which protects the liver and helps with detoxification. So everyone really should take Glutamine (or really expensive glutathione!). After discovering two members of my family have celiac, this became even more important to take to rebuild the intestinal lining that the gluten compromised and help restore health so that the intestine can absorb the nutrients it should--my husband gained 20 lbs in six months (believe me, he needed to!) and he needed to get his cholesterol back up to a healthy level. Glutamine does not cause weight gain--it just repaired his intestinal tract to be able to absorb nutrients. And doctors have always congratulated him on his low cholesterol! Don't allopathic doctors know cholesterol is necessary for many functions? (sorry for the rant!) It's really necessary for us to do our own research and take control of our health decisions.Always take on an empty stomach--I take mine with my probiotic first thing in the morning.Other brands we have used have been slightly gritty, chalky and with a slightly bitter unpleasant aftertaste--we just presumed all glutamine was like that and quickly washed it down with more water. The price is spectacular. Our doctor has met the owner of Jarrow and says he is extremely fastidious (well, he said ""anal,"" lol) about the quality of his products, so when I am deciding between nutritional products now, the Jarrow brand factors heavily. Also, the amount recommended on the container is less, so we are presuming it is because the quality is higher.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

"Uplift Technologies DL930 Day-Light 10,000 Lux SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) Lamp","I've had this light for a few years now, and I like it. I live in NYC and I tend to use it from late October to early March, sometimes as long as the spring equinox.Product Quality:It generates a lot of light for its size. I have not ever experienced the burning smell that others have reported, even when I have it on for an hour at a time (which I sometimes do when I am working, as my desk doesn't allow me to sit at the recommended distance comfortably.) It's solidly built, easy to put together and take apart, and not as precarious as the picture makes it look.It is on the large side, and it won't blend in with your decor unless you live in Ikea, a hospital, or perhaps an early-2000s dot-com cubicle. But if you're buying it, you're probably buying it as a therapeutic device, so the aesthetics should be secondary to its effects.Therapeutic Effect:This is a ""white light"" box, which is the only kind that has been evaluated in peer-reviewed trials according to the nonprofit Center for Environmental Therapeutics. Blue lights haven't been studied very much and full-spectrum lights just include the harmful UVA/UVB rays that we normally wear sunscreen to avoid! Your mileage may vary, but I'd definitely recommend reading up thoroughly before buying any kind of light therapy product. It's like an herbal supplement - no official agency is evaluating the manufacturer's claims, so it's on you to do your research.It's true that the light from this lamp has a bit of a yellow cast, but this doesn't bother me aesthetically and doesn't seem to interfere with its effectiveness -- I haven't tried a higher-power light so I couldn't say for sure, but this one has the desired effects for me. I feel better able to concentrate and remember things, I sleep a little better, and my mood is better on days that I use the lamp. For me it doesn't totally remove the winter blues, but it provides a very noticeable boost.",health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'alternative medicine')"

Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox,"We've always been a multiple-cat household, except for brief In Between Cats periods. As such we've always had multiple litterboxes.We had four litterboxes when we got the two new additions. They were standard litterboxes and the new kittens, well, I don't know how something so adorable made something that smelled THAT bad, but they just were not cutting it. So I figured I'd try these Clever Cat ones since everyone raves about them.I got four. I replaced two of our standard boxes with Clever Cats. At first the covers were off.Problems became apparent almost instantly. All my cats are about 10lbs, so they're not huge, and the kittens were even smaller a few months ago. And they barely fit in these things. I mean, they're cats, of course they ""fit"", but it did not look comfortable. And that's with the tops off.Another problem is cleaning. Because the walls of these boxes are so high, you can only get your scoop in lengthwise. And frankly while it might save on the cats tossing litter all over the place, I was MORE than making up for it when I was cleaning the boxes. Made a HUGE mess since it's impossible to get the scoop in at a comfortable angle without moving the boxes all over the place.Eventually I replaced all four litterboxes, and had to permanently keep the tops off since the cats refused to use the things otherwise... and even then one of the cats still refuses to use them, so we have an Out Of Litterbox Experience for the first time.I've replaced them with standard litterboxes. For me this was a waste of ~$140 since you can't really return or resell used litterboxes. Oh well.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

Jarrow Formulas Inositol Powder,"I am so glad I found this Inositol! I have been taking it for a month and a half and will now never live without it. And Jarrow products are of high quality.As a former java junkie I have likely depleted stores of it in my liver; I probably was deficient in it to begin with. While I thought I ate healthfully I didn't get enough fiber and Inositol is found there.I researched it and found it is supposed to help with Type 2 Diabetes, ADD, ADHD, OCD and SAD. It is important in helping your liver burn fat and blood sugar and remove it from the blood stream. If your liver can't burn fat or handle sugar effectively, then cholesterol starts to accumulate in your body. I have problems with most all these issues. A doc told me I was PCOS ""light"".The biggest boon was to my mood. After a few days of starting it (slowly @ 1/4t increased to ~ 2t a day). I used to be moody and irritable. I noticed at about day 4 my husband and I got into a fight about an oft fought 'bout topic. Normally it would escalate with me being the hotter of the two. This time I was totally cool. I was rational! And the hubby later had to say sorry. That was nice for a change.I think the powder is a nicer form to take it. It mixes easily in water and anything that helps me drink more water the better.

Oxy Life Stabilized Oxygen - w/ Colloidal Silver and Aloe vera - 16oz,"I have had some issues with candidiasis as well as my adopted child. My ND was talking about various products - I know Kevin Trudeau is a big proponent of food grade H2O2 so instead of trying that (the drops in the distilled water protocol as described in books like The One Minute Cure seemed really hard to do when you are dealing with a special needs child and other issues every day) I thought I would let myself give this product a try. I have been doing coconut oil and taking a very good probiotic - Biokult - which is recommended by Dr. Campbell McBride who is behind the specific carb GAPS diet so my personal problems with all of these things have been better - however I did experience some cramping and what I think was a 'die off' herxheimer reaction to some degree the first two days I took this - then I began to feel far better and more energized. I do, however, work with someone who does allergy corrections with the energy vials - like NAET but beyond that - and she said after I'd used this product about two weeks or so that there was some issue that I had to 'treat' for and I had to do that while holding this bottle and doing the acupressure tapping. However the issue seemed to be resolved and I did take my first dose again after being off it some weeks and I do think it has helped my energy.One other benefit - I have fought constant cystic acne on my back since puberty - it's been better since I've been working on food allergies and the candida issues and taking some hormonal stuff to help with an imbalance but this was the only product that really made a difference on my skin. And it has helped my energy. I can't speak for anyone else.My friend who does that energy work says 'everyone is a snowflake' meaning everyone is such an individual you really do not know if you will handle this product that one person got great benefit from but another person may not tolerate well, so I just think bear that in mind. On the flip side, it's not much money to give a shot - I have blown far far more on vitamins and drugs et al which I promptly had to chuck out from having a bad side effect reaction. One dose of the cipro family antibiotic avelox nearly sent me to the hospital once - after having to shell out nearly $130 for a ten day supply. I have had chronic sinusitis which is why I was always taking antibiotics and why I think my gut is messed up now, amongst other reasons including food allergies, etc. The coconut oil, oil pulling with it, taking it orally, cooking with it and adding this to the mix has helped a lot. I have not had to take an antibiotic for a sinus infection in over 2 years and this was after taking them for 30 years sometimes multiple times during the year for recurring infections. So that is another plus.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

3M STERI-STRIP Skin Closure - 1/2 x 4 - Envelope,"I fell into the corner of a wall while sleepwalking (I know, I know, how ridiculous) and managed to split open my chin. I had to get 8 stitches, and I had a huge gross stitched line on my chin, which is hardly the new accessory I wanted for my work look. I tried bandaids, but the face is an oily place, and they would just peel off all the time, especially with the location on my chin moving the bandage so much when I talked. Also, regular bandaids just look gross right on your face like that. Ugh. But then, I went to the doctor to get the stitches removed, and she used these steri-strips to hold the wound shut (they take out face stitches way earlier than full healing, because you don't want to heal around the stitches and end up with a huge and raised scar).Anyway, these steri-strips were BEYOND FANTASTIC for covering the wound/scar as it was healing; I kept it covered at all times because of hygienic reasons since the cut was so close to my mouth, and at night as well because it itched and the steri-strip protected it from me unconsciously scratching it.I love these so much.Then a coworker was getting moles removed, so I gave her the extra package of these I had bought, and she loved them too. If the wound is still open or sore, these will stick a bit, so just use a little neosporin so it won't stick. Otherwise though, these STAY PUT, which is really helpful.Oh, in my experience, be sure to change these every day. They'll feel like they could stick forever, and once the wound had healed into a scar, I was tempted to leave these for longer than a day, and they'll easily last for that, but when left on longer than about a day, the adhesive gets kind of gummy sticky, which isn't pleasant.Overall, I love these...but I'm thrilled I don't have to wear them anymore!",health personal care,health care,first aid,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'first aid')"

Nylabone Durable Dental Dinosaur Chew Toy (Dinosaur Varies),"We were pulling our hair out because our boxer mix is about 10 months old and it seems she has jaws of steel.

Most toys she destroys in minutes; this one it took two weeks to get the face off and a month for her to chew off the head. She loves her dinosaur and I plan on getting her more.

Also, due to concerns about mercury in the municipal solid waste stream, Duracell has eliminated all of the added mercury from their alkaline batteries. Basically, their alkaline batteries are composed primarily of common metals--steel, zinc, and manganese. Having said that it's important not to dispose of large amounts of alkaline batteries in a group. Used batteries are often not completely ""dead.""

Rare ZZ Plant-Zamioculcas zamiifolia - House Plant - Bonsai,"I bought a zz plant a few years ago and read about how they're slow growers, prefers low light and very little water. I was happy when the plant came, it was healthy and fairly big. My plant took off, started growing fast and produced thick green leaves and new shoots. During winter I kept it in a south facing window and come summer it was outside on my patio where it got direct sun from morning till roughly 11am. The plant didn't burn and grew even better. Eventually I had relatives that wanted to know where I got it from and even a friend of my moms said that she used to see these in Poland. So i ordered more from this vendor. The plants are always healthy but this time around the plants were much smaller. I don't mind the smaller plants just because they grow quicker than i expected. If it gets no direct light and low indirect light it wont grow much and won't take much water. But during summer months I used fertilizer and Super Thrive and my plants grew pretty quickly. They do need a fair amount of water during summer months, but you'll be rewarded with a healthy and beautiful plant. In the winter months they do well in pretty much any part of the house. I've even plucked a couple leafs and started new plants in party cups.

"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black","The Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor is a decent weapon for the price when it comes to fighting the battle of the bulge. It provides an important window into body fat composition that a regular scale does not. (Of course, you could just purchase a scale that does the same thing.) But it could be better.The initial setup is rather straight forward, but there's a lot of subjectivity when it comes to choosing the ""FIT"" level (a part of the initial setup that determines whether the user should select the ""Normal"" or ""Athlete"" setting.) Since there are 8 user memory settings, I chose to set up 1 slot with ""Normal"", and a second slot with ""Athlete"" just to see the difference. What I found was that the fat % figure was around 3% lower on the Athlete setting, while the BMI figure was identical.Obviously, since this isn't a scale, you have to weigh yourself on an accurate scale first in order to input that information into the HBF-306C's initial setup (and keep updating that figure to keep the readout of this device accurate as well).I found that using the device is pretty straight forward, with one possible exception",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,health monitors,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'health monitors')"

We've since moved it to her bathroom so it wasn't a distraction. But she still loves to go in the bathroom and look at it, grab for it, watch it spin around.The quality is great, the sheep are made of plastic.

The other reason was the rounded tips to utilize for spots that I'd otherwise nick myself.These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts. These scissors are absolutely tiny! As a result, you can't really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears. For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair. This thing just isn't big enough to do the job.

Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,"I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS of the electrical transformer not working or failing shortly after first using, however, I chose ignore the negative comments because of the high percentage of good reviews.

Not only was there no power to the track, the whistle did not worked on the transformer either. I called the Lionel ""Customer Service"" number listed on the assembly instructions. A recording said I was number 9 in line. I waited OVER TWO HOURS until I finally got down to the #2 position in line. I waited for another 20 minutes and still no one answered so I finally gave up.

I had it refit twice, by both the vet and her trainer at obedience school. I finally figured out that the initial fit was not the problem but it was that the adjustment buckle doesnt hold the nylon strap tight enough--so that's why she can loosen it while it's on (I marked the right fit with a black pen so I could tell when it had slipped). I only confirmed it was a problem specific to this purchase when I recently bought another one at REI and found that the nylon did not slip through the buckle nearly as easily. I actually think the nylon in the new one feels totally different. It's hard to know whether the problem is the material (my vote) or the buckle but either way, this one is useless.

I admit that I don't have KP, and I was only seeking the preventative benefits of this lotion, but I think I'm better off ""sticking"" to my coconut oil. This product should certainly be only used at bedtime. If you use it before getting dressed for the day, you may never get your clothes to fit right. If I get a rash, this product is going right back to Amazon. I'm holding out hope for the SPF version - I'll try that, tomorrow, but will allow plenty of time, just in case I need to jump back into the shower.",beauty,skin care,body,"('beauty', 'skin care', 'body')"

I was doing some research and came across a lot of pet owners who dogs were having similiar issues and they changed to a higher grade food. I was feeding him Diamond, so it wasnt the bottom of the barrel, but I believe that was the root of our problem. Our vet just kept telling us to keep his ears clean, etc, groom him, but we were doing all of these things.

Ravensburger Funny Bunny - Children's Game,"This is a fun and easy game. Our 3 and 5 year olds really enjoy playing it.

Players take turns drawing cards which either have you move your bunny 1, 2, or 3 spots or have you turn the carrot in the middle which moves the rabbit hole around the board. The object of the game is to get one of your bunnies to the center of the board without falling into the shifting hole.My only complaint is that I wish it had more cards (you go through the deck quickly, especially if you are playing with 4 people), so we didn't have to shuffle so many times each game.",toys games,games,board games,"('toys games', 'games', 'board games')"

North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,I&#8217;m using this gate to keep my dog in the bathroom while I&#8217;m away from the house. The gate requires you to drill into the wall/frame and screw in 4 loops where the gate will attach. I picked this one specifically because my bathroom door is 24&#8221; and there didn&#8217;t seem to be a huge selection of gates that were that narrow. This one fits perfectly. It&#8217;s pretty easy to open and close but you do have to make sure the bottom hook catches the loop which can make it more difficult to open and close with one hand. Not impossible though.If you are using this for dogs and your dog likes to chew you may want to consider a metal one.

As soon as these get wet in your mouth the gel capsule becomes very tacky and can easily get stuck in your throat. I have learned that as long as I take three of four big gulps of water as soon as I take them it doesn't happen. But if I just treat these like a regular pill and take with a small sip of water, they get stuck nearly every time.

I thought I'd try these to help in body recovery from those.I can't say objectively that they made any difference whatsoever. I can find no scientific support to show that this supplement contributes notably to any situation. All the ""data"" is testimonial.. which is pretty useless.As winter has set in, I have become far less motivated and have let my condition deteriorate... well at least I no longer have sore muscles from conditioning exercise.I think ONLY if you're on a SERIOUS conditioning program that leaves you with notable muscle soreness of the ""good kind"" (the kind you get when you know you're stressing and rebuilding muscle.. not injuries), then you might use these to the extent you think it helps.However, if you're in any other situation...

"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige","While my wife had traditional assumed liter box duties, after moving into a smaller home it was hard to argue that the only reasonable place for the litter box wasn't a closet a few feet from my computer chair, a place where I spend a considerable amount of my retirement day. (Fortunately, a generally stuffed nose makes this bearable.) Every morning with coffee I bring up a fixed set of webpages for perusing, with one of the pages being one that I created on my hard drive that shows a cartoon cat with the admonishment ""Please clean my litter box"". When I reach it in my daily progression I seldom hesitate to comply because it requires so little effort; I simply pivot in my chair, swing the closet door further open, bend down and roll the box over and back as proscribed. At that point I must admit that I have to leave my chair to deposit my findings in the toilet across the hall (I swear by World's Best Cat Litter).I have been using this box for over a year, and have absolutely no complaints. It takes a while to perfect the rolling technique (slow and extreme), and how to keep the box properly topped up (little or no extra litter in the tray indicates that it's time to add some). It does take a lot of space to perform the roll, but if you've got it this box is a winner!

"Vetri-Science Perio-Support, 4.2 Ounce.","A very little bit of this goes a long way so I am pleased with the price of the bottle given the amount. We mix it into the Meow Mix line of small cups of cat food that used to come in pouches since that happens to be a treat for our cats. It's a littler harder to mix into the all-natural cans that aren't as full of gravy, but if you do it when you first pop the can and then gently reheat the stuff to room temp before serving, they'll take it without giving you the ole Kitteh-Kat stink-eye! We also sometimes sneak it into tuna water for our oldest who doesn't like ""da gushy fudz"" but who needed 3 people to hold her and 2 to sedate her for her one and only teeth cleaning and still 3 people got sliced and diced! We call her our Cat-The-Ripper!This being the case, when I got the bottle, I called up my Vet and read him the ingredients over the phone. He had to do a little research and called me back reminding me that training a cat or dog from infancy to accept a pet toothbrush with poultry flavored paste is the BEST way to stay on top of tarter before it even has a chance to form into Biofilm which then hardens into tarter, he gave this product the OK as a back-up plan. Only 1 of my cats (we have 3) accepts a pet toothbrush and even then only those finger brushes you slip over your thumb. Still, he gave us his full support but asked us to ramp up our use slowly, starting with 1/4 the recommended dose and increasing that every two days and now we've been at full strength for a while. His feeling was, if you won't or they won't let you brush their teeth, anything is better than nothing so long as it's not made of harmful ingredients. There are some mushroom derivatives in here so if you have a cat with some strange allergy to edible mushrooms (and not merely fungi like ringworm that live in the ground and cause rashes on cats), show this to your vet. Mine was fine with the ingredient list, having seen the product in use with other clients plus he knows my pets very well. He's eager to see how ours respond.Perio-Support is only our second try at a preventative. Our first was with a water addative and that didn't work at all since none of the pets would drink and also we keep their water super fresh so we were wasting a lot of product. No, this powder seems to be a good fall-back. It's too soon to see any huge difference in the one cat with the beginnings of brown lines on her fangs but she eats it happily. We have seen no increase in Kitteh-Kat blorphing of food or just stomach juices which happenes with older cats, cats who sneak out and eat grass, or cats like Cat-The-Ripper who occasionally inhale too much dry food they love and forget to chew it well. In fact, we've seen a minor downturn in hairball up-chucks in Cat-The-Ripper who is a HUGE cat (not fat; just really huge for a cat) who has longer hair and therefore grooms a lot more. The Perio-support seems to be helping her out with that. All 3 cats eat the stuff if we mix it well into the can as soon as we open it, even the expensive stuff with less gravy.I'll have to come back in 6 months time and tell you if we see a difference but I'm going to keep buying just to see if the hairball reduction is a real effect. There are so MANy happy customers that I believe this stuff can work, even for Cat-The-Ripper!",pet supplies,cats,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'health supplies')"

"Bemka.com Russian Ossetra Crown Farmed Caviar, 2-Ounce Jar","This has to be truly a JOKE. Much like all the other caviar available online/amazon and all over the place. All I'm going to say is this -- caviarastrakhan.com (the website is in English)People, please save your money and don't fall for this scam. Paying this kind of money for farmed (or really any kind) caviar is truly absurd and not fair, not to mention that farmed caviar can't even come close to REAL caviar. So save your money, and read on so you can get yourself some real (and best in the world) caviar for half the price.There is a Russian company called CaviarAstrakhan (caviarastrakhan.com), which as their name suggest is actually located in Astrakhan (this is THE only place in the world where the fish species needed to make Beluga, Osetra and Sevruga caviars exist and reproduce in their natural habitat, they are also found on the IRANIAN side but caviar from IRAN is far worse in quality). Genuine Russian caviar is known to be the best in the world, and Astrakhan caviar is considered THE BEST bar none. That being said, this company sells Astrakhan caviar on their website and ships all over the world, they accept payment in dollars or euros. Generally, Beluga caviar is considered to be the BEST kind, but they feature all 3 (Beluga, Osetra, Sevruga) so you can pick and choose what you like, they have special deals and bundles. As an example to compare to this deal here, you can buy one 4oz jar of Beluga caviar for $98 on caviarastrakhan.com while here you would pay $187 for 2oz of farmed caviar (it makes NO sense). That means you're paying $93 an ounce for this farmed caviar here, that's just a few dollars short of what you'd pay for 4oz of the best caviar in the world!

It works for longer periods of time without any of the dangerous side effects associated with pharmaceuticals.One year ago I was hospitalized with deep venous thrombosis. My major veins were clotted shut from groin to heel in my left leg. I spent 6 months on Coumadin and was told that two thirds of my leg had not resolved but the Coumadin couldn't help any further and that I was doomed with post thrombotic syndrome/post phlebotic pain syndrome and venous insufficiency for the rest of my life.

Amazing Herbs Black Seed,"I am 57 and have had fibromyalgia for years . I have so much more energy when I take this and the aches and pains have diminished so much I forget I have fibromyalgia. I have been able to rake my very large yard and do hand sewing without the terrible swelling and pain in the evening or the following day. I had been off my pain meds due to a terrible lag time from my doctor's office and my pharmacy and now I am considering going without to see how much benefit I can truly reap from black seed oil. After a long day, lying in bed at night used to be very painful, taking at least an hour for my body to &#34; settle&#34; so that I could even try to relax over the pain, especially in my feet. It now takes about five to ten minutes to &#34;settle&#34;. One great benefit is that my spider veins on my legs are disappearing. That's such a confidence booster, for older women in particular. I really don't like to go to the doctor, but the last time I was there they said my chlorestoral was up. I think that the black seed oil will prove to be working on that as well. And one last thing, the extra weight around my middle has been reduced, and I have only started taking black seed oil about three and a half weeks ago. I feel very happy and excited to have found something that works for me on SO many levels. The down side is that I can only find this online right now.

We tried it for the first time right before a 3hr car ride (he usually has anxiety in the car) and to my surprise, his anxiety was actually WORSE than it normally is in the car.

They seem to be holding up really well and justify the expense. They also do a great job of keeping my ankles from swelling on plane rides. I purchased them for a 14 hour flight from LAX to Bangkok and they were a lifesaver. Possibly literally as they prevent blood clots too.

Wahl 4120-200 All-Body Massage Powerful Therapeutic Massager in Pharmacy Box,"I know a lot of girls have been reviewing the benefit for their own private area but I have been using this for the past few months on my injured shoulders.

I can feel the head hitting the exact spot that is stiff and after 10-20 minutes it is feeling much better and my arms are a lot looser.My girlfriend also gets knots in her neck a lot and loves it when I use this on her to get them out.

Aloe life Skin Gel - 8 oz - Liquid,"When I was breaking out really badly, my friend gave me some of this and told me to use it as a spot treatment.

I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.) but nothing has worked even close to as well as this does! Plus it doesn't burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin. Now I rarely ever get acne! I've also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin). Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands.

"Conair TS7NR Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter, Jumbo","So you can compare to your hair type to my review, I have long, thick, and soft hair with a slight wave that typically curls easily.First, it is hard to put these rollers in your hair. There is a slit in the roller where it straddles a metal bar to heat up. When you try to put a u-shaped clip in, it often gets stuck in the slit. I tried the clamps at 3 different angles and they kink my hair.Next, these don't curl your hair well. I let them heat up longer, left them in longer, tried using hairspray while they were in, but nothing worked.The worst part is they don't stay in your hair well once you finally get them in. I tried rolling up with less hair to make my hair curl better, but then the rollers just slide out of my hair. The last straw was when one of the rollers slid out of my hair and fell in the toilet at a hotel.Done with this set, and they went to the trash!!I hope to find some of the plastic kind in at least 1.5"" size.

"Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce","The sandalwood cream lathers real quickly and you wouldn't need more than four dabs of cream to work up some rich lather with a badger shaving brush.

Snoozer Lookout Car Seat,"I bought two for my Chihuahuas. Basically this is a big block of foam the dog sits on top of. One dog kept jumping out and getting hung up on the seat belt. Never use this seat with a collar, only a harness. There is too muh leeway since the tether slides along the length of the seat belt. The only way to make them work right would be to cut a hole through the back and put the tether through that. The other dog did fine, but you never know when a dog will decided to jump out.

Astonish Industries Oven & Cookware Cleaner 17.6 Oz.,"I bought this to see if it would be able to remove the (small but noticeable to me) spots/stains on our older, white gas stovetop, but this product didn't do much of anything for it. My Mr. Clean Magic Erasers did a much better job at getting most of the staining, so I'm going to roll up my sleeves and show those few remaining spots no mercy...This Astonish cleaner is a finely gritted white paste and I can see how this would be suitable and effective for many things, but just wasn't (effective) for my primary purpose of the stove top. It does appear just a little of this will go a long way, which makes it a cost-effective product. I did test a small area on some (vintage) mustard-colored cookware, but quickly stopped as it appeared to be causing some surface damage (slightly removing the finish). I'm sure that I will find some other use for it at some point, such as stainless steel, oven interior, vehicle wheels/rims, etc. or something that can handle the grit texture.",health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning,"('health personal care', 'household supplies', 'household cleaning')"

Universal Nutrition Animal Test,"This product always gets the full spectrum of reviews on any website, so be aware that results vary greatly according to your individual training and biochemistry.My ExperienceI took the full 42 day course of Animal Test to break out of a 4 month strength slump. This was my seventh year of dedicated weight training and it had been roughly 2 years since my last hiatus due to injury/lifestyle changes. I began to feel like it was working by week 2 and my lifting numbers were up about 10% in the big three and as much as 30% in assistance excercises by the end of the 6 weeks. I also gained 10 pounds without eating much more. These results pretty well match my bodies reaction to weightlifing stimuli, in that gaining strength is pretty easy and thinking about food piles on the pounds. I was in somewhat of a better mood while taking it, but it was likely a function of feedback from training. For those of you who train, you know how much the feeling of grabbing a comically large weight and dominating the lift carries over to the rest of your life. The body weight stayed on until I went on a diet a few months later and the strength was all there until my recent injury over a year after taking Animal Test.Bigger PictureI did some research on various ingrediants and read a lot of reviews before ordering. All I can say is that you should be ready to closely evaluate how the product is reacting with your body. I had a great experience, but others have reported the following,Increased agressionWeight lossNipple swelling/puffinessAcne/backne outbreaksWorsening stomach painsNo effect at allSo, be prepared to carefully evaluate how you feel during week one of Animal Test. If you feel normal or better, carry on. If negative side effects arise, stop taking immediantly. I would also not recommend this for people under 21, as a lot of the negative reactions I have seen were posted by teens.I liked it so much, I am ordering another two can cycle.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,"In this review, I will make note of tips, tricks, and ways to make the experience with diva cup amazing as well as actually review the product itself. ;)First off, I LOVE my diva cup! The diva cup is an excellent alternative to pads and tampons and is great price-wise since it is reusable! If you are a woman (well, hopefully you are if you are reading this...) and are tired of spending time and money being uncomfortable during that time of the month, I 100% recommend that you purchase the diva cup!There that was my short review! Now onto how to make your experience with diva cup better:1) A lot of women ponder the thought, ""What if my diva cup is too long? Diva cups are the longest menstrual cup on the market..."" Well, when I first got the diva cup, it actually was too long. I could feel it ALL THE TIME. But, I fixed the problem by cutting off part of the stem (yes, you can do that!! :D).2) Insertion can seem impossible when you first open the package and see the size. But trust me, it fits! I find that doubling the diva cup over into a U-shape is the easiest way to insert. Also, to get the best suction possible, as soon as it goes into your vaginal canal, release the diva cup so that it goes into its natural position. Then, push it down the canal as far as it can go!3) When removing the diva cup, you should ALWAYS pinch it first! The diva cup stays down there by suction, so to remove it, you need to release the suction power it has. If you do not pinch it and release its pull, it REALLY hurts to remove!4) There IS a reason it says to wear it for only 12 hours! I tested on the 2nd day of my period wearing it for close to 24 hours. For one thing, it leaked. I have heavy flow and it did overflow after 24 hours... Secondly, and almost worse, the cup smelled bad. Like, really bad...5) Speaking of smelling bad - an important thing to know is how to clean your diva cup! I know a few reviews said not to use soap, but I first wash my hands and then wash the inside and outside of my diva cup with antibacterial soap. The trick is running your hands all over the cup to make sure it is soap-free when you are done! It is also VERY important that you wash your hands prior to cleaning out your diva cup! Also, once a month I boil mine in water. You can add some lemon juice to boiling water if you want it to smell good, FYI. ;)6) If you are in a public place and need to clean your cup, I would use some baby wipes. And if you do not have any, just wipe your cup out with toilet paper. BUT, make sure all the TP is gone when you are done cleaning!7) ALWAYS wash your hands before insertion or removal! Doing so will reduce your chance of getting infections down there!8) EDIT TO ADD",health personal care,personal care,feminine care,"('health personal care', 'personal care', 'feminine care')"

Universal Nutrition Animal Nitro,"Animal Nitro is an interesting alternative to your standard post-workout serving of protein powder. I personally find that it far outperforms every powder product I have tried in terms of aiding in post-workout recovery by preventing soreness, both in the short and delayed onset form. Taking the pills in and of itself will not make you bigger or stronger. Instead, the enhanced recovery allows to come back into the gym/bike/field the day after a hard workout and hit the weights just as hard. The most noticeable difference was after leg day, when I would feel comfortable enough to go on 20 mile cycling rides or do strongman training despite being in the squat rack 24 hours earlier.Recovery with Nitro > Recovery with whey protein powder > No supplement recoveryAs a word of caution, make sure you drink a lot of water while taking the pak of horse pills, like a full 16 ozs. They can get stuck in your throat, causing a lot of discomfort, follewed by aspirating protein dust five minutes later. Not to scare anyone off, just helping you to avoid a bad experience.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

She now has a show quality chow chow coat and I have to attribute it to the Optima 365. It truly was a wonder supplement for her and I have suggested Optima 365 to other dog owners who also had friends with problem coats or skin and they also had very satisfactory results with it.

"Dove Pink Beauty Bar, 8 Count","I can't believe that I'm writing a review about a bar of soap, but here goes. I have very dry skin and also have hard water in my house. The only solution to my dry skin is to either apply a greasy lotion several times a day, or use Dove soap. Since I hate using lotions, the Dove soap became my only option. Sure enough, the Dove soap effectively moisturizes my skin, so it is no longer dry and cracked. The reason why I'm only rating it 3 stars, is because the soap doesn't last long at all. Between my wife and me, we go through an entire bar in three days, sometimes two days if we exercise and take two showers a day. If you're a magician, you might want to use this soap in your disappearing magic act. In that case, it would be more cost effective than a rabbit. But for personal use, I consider the price unreasonable for the disappearing act it does in the shower. Dove used to come in 5 ounce bars, than it was reduced to 4.5 ounce bars, now it's down to just 4 ounces. At the rate it's going, I'll need to wear glasses in the shower just to find it.",beauty,bath body,cleansers,"('beauty', 'bath body', 'cleansers')"

Nature's Way Flax Oil,"I had gastric bypass almost 2 years ago and as part of the protocol I'm supposed to have a protein shake every morning. A friend of mine recommended that I take Flax Seed Oil and/or Fish Oil due to the many health benefits it provides. So I thought I would start adding it to my shakes every morning.It looked a little funny at first. You're supposed to shake up the bottle real good and then squirt the oil out through the ""valve"" bottle opening. It actually looks pretty gross. It's got bits of seed in there but it's explained on the bottle that it's expected. So I went with it.To my surprise it actually enhanced the flavor of the shake and made it noticeably smoother! I think this is an excellent product and with this very reasonable price I'm happy that I can do a little something more to make myself more healthy with very little added daily cost.For those who are interested and need a protein shake every day, here is my very delicious recipe (Note, this isn't exactly low calorie!):1.5 (12 oz) water2 scoops ofOptimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound2-3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter1 Banana1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil1-2 Cups of Ice (depending on how ""shakey"" you want it to be)Blend until smooth*** UPDATE *** Just got my second bottle of this stuff.

I do not have the door attached as I want him to go in and out at will. ;)If you are using this as a pen, then I would suggest it for a small to extra small dog or rabbit.

The bottle is also a constant problem, because there's always some of this glue-like paste that runs into and around the cap. Every time you unscrew the top you'll have a mess on your hands and will eventually need to scrape the stuff off. I didn't need to use much of it so the bottle might not bother other people.

SE Small Pill/ID Holder Keychain (Set of 6),"As I said, for the price these are simply amazing. Each one comes with a little clear plastic vial that can hold something the size of about 1 Tylenol gelcap. If you remove the plastic vial, you can easily fit 2. I carry two Tylenol gel-caps in 1 container, I wrap them with a bit of plastic wrap to keep them somewhat protected and so far this has worked great. I keep two of these canisters on my edc keychain, one I've managed (with some trial and error) a $20 bill (in the green one :]), and the medicine in the other. These do have some small metal shavings inside them, which is why I recommend using some type of plastic covering around any pills. If you over tighten them the little o-rings do have a habit of 'popping' out/off, however you can make the top screw on and stay rather tight by just being careful and few should have any problems with this.These are very light weight aluminum and the treading is ok for what they are.

"Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)","This tea is odd. It has a deceptively fruity smell, but tastes like nothing with a vague hint of something mildly fruity. Labeling the tea a ""blueberry"" tea was pretty inaccurate, in my opinion. (There are much tastier and much more fragrant fruit teas available on the market!) If you let it oversteep, it gets bitter and acidic. Maybe I got a bad batch (of 6 boxes??), but every bag I had tasted like it was fairly old and maybe stale. I started getting in the habit of waiting for the tea to cool and gulping it back as fast as possible, because the taste bothered me so much.I also chose this tea because it says it gives you energy. Despite drinking multiple cups a day for a month, I felt absolutely no effect on my energy levels (compared to my normal drink choice of unflavored green tea from various brands). If you never drink any caffeine, maybe you'd feel an ""energy boosting"" effect, but that's unlikely if you're already a tea lover.I do not recommend this tea. The other Yogi teas I've tried are much higher quality.The only reason I gave my review two stars instead of one is because if anything, the teabags are high quality, as you would expect for such an expensive tea. (I've never had a bag fall apart--too bad I'm only drinking it because I hate throwing out tea!)",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,"('grocery gourmet food', 'beverages', 'tea')"

John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine Luminous Color Glaze-6.5 oz (192 ml),"I purchased this glaze to help cover up a few grays between colorings and to give me some overall shine. I already use the John Frieda foam colour (currently using light ash brown) and found this glaze while looking for another batch of permanent color. I though it might extend the time between colorings just a bit. I found the consistency of the glaze a little difficult to apply in the shower. I often found it sliding off my wet/damp hair before I could get it rubbed in. Since I was interested in covering grays, I started at my scalp and would then rub and comb the product down to the ends of my shoulder-blade-length hair. As mentioned by other reviewers - this stuff stains. That's the idea, right? But note that it stains skin as well as hair. It's difficult to rinse it all off the scalp without scrubbing it - which would remove it from the gray roots I'm trying to cover. And be sure to scrub, scrub, scrub your hands with some soap while you're waiting for the product to do its thing in your hair. (This stuff would make a great instant tan if you're going for a too-long-in-the-booth look.) Some days I rinse too well (or didn't leave it on long enough) and it doesn't look like I've even used the product. Other days I think this product adds a lovely shine. And some days if it doesn't get rinsed just right it just plain looks greasy. Feels like too much of a gamble to use this product on a regular basis.I would not recommend it for covering grays (even if only temporarily) because of the scalp staining issue. If you spend enough time perfecting your technique, it would probably provide a good shine to hair that just needs a little boost.",beauty,hair care,hair color,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'hair color')"

"Lakota Black Spot Horse 10"" by Douglas Cuddle Toys","Below is my original review; I loved the horse but hated the fact that the bridle/reins and saddle were sewn in & could not be removed. Actually they are only ""tacked"" in with a couple stitches which were hard to see as the threads were black on black. If you carefully use either a seam ripper or SMALL pair of scissors you can easily remove them. My daughter is having a lot of fun--both items are easy for her to remove & put back on (a huge plus for me!)This is a wonderful horse, size is exactly as described & has a wonderful expression and soft coat. The problem is with the saddle and bridle--they are NOT removable. Well, unless you cut them off. The saddle girth strap is sown into the horse's belly and the bridle is sown under the chin and throat. This is fine if the horse is just meant to sit on a shelf, but I bought this for my daughter to actually play with. When she's done with ""riding"", she likes to take everything off & brush the horse, just like a real one. I just know I'm going to end up cutting both saddle and bridle off which is really a shame--would have been very easy to just make them removable. I'm not sure if the bridle will be salvageable after cutting.",toys games,stuffed animals plush,animals figures,"('toys games', 'stuffed animals plush', 'animals figures')"

Source Naturals L-Pyroglutamic Acid 1000mg,"I took .25 of tablet and slept really well with tons of very vivid dreams. The next morning I felt great, but later in the day a bit weird. Hard to explain, maybe a bit anxious and distracted. Decided not to take it the next day and still had very vivid dreams. This dream effect lasted for about a week before wearing off. Seems like the stuff should be out of a person's system before that, but that is my anecdotal experience. Tried another.25 tablet and had pretty much the same experience. I use a Zeo to track sleep, and I noticed something I had never seen before, which is that during one part of the night my sleep was so deep it didn't even register. Had the same anxiety/distraction later that day. The next night I didn't take it and had similar sleep experiences. When I woke and checked my Zeo I saw that there was a part of the night that showed I was awake. Very strange because I had no memory of it. Later that morning it came to me and I remembered being awake and thinking about a variety of things but I might never had remembered that if it weren't for the Zeo reminding me. This is a very strange thing to happen and kind of reminds me of some of those stories you hear about people on Ambien doing nutty things at night and not remembering them.So, am I just hypersensitive? Is this a typical reaction? Who knows. Not a lot of info for this supplement. I'm personally worried about trying a higher dose, but that worry might be unfounded. There is some discussion on some of the forums about some neurotoxic effects of this supplement, but that is also speculation at this point. Anyway, I'm giving 3 stars as it is clearly effective, but are the effects good/healthy or not? I don't know.

LifeSource UA-774AC Dual Memory Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with Medium and Large Cuff and AC Adapter,I had this product for eight years.

Bohnanza,"This is a game that I discovered by accident and I can't be happier that I did. This game is a nice & easy counterpart to some more complex games that I play regularly with my game group, and the beauty lies in the simplicity. Each player (2-7 can play) attempt to collect similar types of beans (which are comically illustrated on the cards) & harvest those beans for gold coins. The most coins at the end of the game wins.Although the game is very simple on the surface, the fun & replay ability comes from the fact that you are allowed (and encouraged!) to interact with your competitors. Most of the game action involves trying to negotiate trades between players to try and accumulate the beans you want while getting rid of the beans you don't. The strategy isn't too difficult, but if you aren't in the mood for a deeply involved, hours long game then this is perfect. I would put it nearly on par with7 Wonders Gamefor depth of strategy (although 7 Wonders is a little more difficult as there are many more rules).The first time through this game was a little difficult to understand the dynamic, but now I am able to teach a table full of beginners in about 10 minutes. Being a card only game, setup time is virtually non-existent. Just unbox & play! The only thing to note is that you use slightly different arrangements of which cards get used for different numbers of players. This also prevents some cards from wearing faster than others which is a complaint I have with some other card games that use specific cards more often than others (Dominionspecifically).",toys games,games,board games,"('toys games', 'games', 'board games')"

She herds it all around the house.Update:We have lost all our puppy teeth, and she can scratch into the side of the ball as she is biting and chasing it. She will actually stand on top of the ball, and bite down on it and it will move out from under her. I just use a razor blade and cut off the longer pieces, but I didn't think this would happen!!!! She will have this for years no doubt, but I was truly shocked when she started biting into it and scoring slivers off like cheese in a cheese grater. It is funny how she knows that the bathroom is a dead end street, the kitchen tile moves a lot faster than the carpet, and how the coffee table is something that she can lap over and over again. She will chase the ball into a pine cabinet I made in junior high school, and I am afraid that she is going to split one of the doors in half. It is made out of 1"" pine, but one door doesn't make noise when the ball hits it, so she has perfect the technique to have it hit the one that does!

"Nioxin Cleanser, System 1 (Fine/Untreated/Normal to Thin-Looking)","I am in my late 50's and when you age, your hair just loses it lustre. The shine is gone and it eally just has that old lady, cotton candy look. I thought I would try the Nioxin system for color-treated hair. Previously, I was using WEN products and that really helped, but with the WEN I had to wash my hair every single day.So I picked some Nioxin up at my salon to give it a try. The Nioxin is a 3 part product, shampoo, conditioner, and then a scalp treatment that I try to remember to use. With Nioxin, I can get away with washing my hair every 3-4 days, and it looks great! Of course, I throw it up on my head and braid it after the first day, but I tell you I love this product better than WEN. so really, since I don't wash my hair everyday, it cost less than WEN.I highly recommend it to everyone. I met with a friend of mine I hadn't seen in a while and she wanted to know what I was doing to my hair. She went online immediately to get some!I would recommend to anyone losing their hair, like combing it and lots and lots of hair coming out, or it coming out in the shower--see your doctor. This could be a problem with thyroid that will not be helped by any hair product. If your labs check out fine, then you should go for the product.

Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,"I received this yesterday as a sort of Christmas present for our dog, a 'golden-doodle'. He had all three squirrels out in less than 1 minute so the getting them out part of the fun didn't last long. Within 2-3 hours he figured out if he just shook the tree around all three squirrels would literally fly out in 2-3 seconds in impressive fashion.One of the three squirrels is unrecognizable 24 hours later, tattered to pieces, a second is hanging on with stuffing bleeding out and the third is mostly intact. The 'tree' hasn't held up much better, there is already a new hole in the bottom. I'm thinking within 2-3 days the entire setup will be destroyed.Our dog is definitely kept busy by it and likes to play with both the squirrels and tree. The moment he notices the squirrels are back in the tree he rushes to the tree and shakes them all out and fuddles around with them for awhile. The down side is it just isn't very durable. We had a floor full of stuffing within an hour of leaving out the new toy from the 1st dead squirrel. I'm fairly sure I'll end up throwing away what remains of this toy in about 3-4 days.If your dog is less of a chewer, this is probably a great toy. If your dog is feisty and likes to kill animal toys (like mine) this won't last long.",pet supplies,dogs,toys,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'toys')"
"Now Foods, L-Lysine 500 mg Vegetarian","After I got influenza a few years back I got the worst cold sore outbreak I've ever had. I was a mess. A doctor prescribed me an antiviral. Later another doctor who I was having drinks with (and not on the clock) confirmed that the prescription antivirals aren't really very helpful. I've never had any luck with them anyways. She told me to take large doses of lysine (5000 mg a day) each day if I feel an outbreak starting and it should nip it in the bud. I had nothing to lose and lysine is super cheap.The next time I felt that familiar soreness and tingling, I started taking lysine. The next day there was no swelling and the tingling and pain were 100% gone. I kept this up for years without a single outbreak.Sometimes if you act slowly you can't help it. Once it gets the white swells of visible pus, you are doomed to a beautiful cold sore. It takes some getting used to to know when is too late. Sometimes the difference between too late and just in time is only an hour or two. You need to just have this on hand and start it the second you feel anything. In fact, you should start it when you know you've had a trigger. For me it's anything that causes a fever and excessive sunshine (sun is a common one, didn't learn that until this year). The key for this to work is catching it early enough.This is the best and only cold sore cure out there. It really, really works. I am a convert. I have bottles of lysine everywhere I go frequently, so I am never surprised and miss a chance. I have one when I travel, one at work, one at home, and one at my parents' house for when I visit.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

Star Wars Power of the Force Electronic Power F/X Action Figure - Luke Skywalker with Glowing Lightsaber and Remote Dueling Action,"Although this is an older figure from the late 1990's, it still has some very cool features.

Put together with Vader, it creates a pretty cool mini-diorama.You may observe that Luke wears a cape, which is admittedly not in the movie, but it still looks good.Due to its battery, there is limited articulation, but unlike some of the newer figures with light-up features, the batteries on THIS figure, as well as Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, R2-D2, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, from the Power of the Force Electronic Power F/X line, are replaceable.

"Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 25-Pound Box","I was living with 2 cats and 1 litter box in a tiny Manhattan apartment. In desperation I asked the guy at my pet supply store (you know Sammy, who plays guitar on a stool outside the shop on warm evenings, on Christopher across from the Hangar?) what was absolutely the best litter. He pointed me straight to Ever Clean. Yes, it's expensive, and I don't know anything about the environmental impacts of clay litter. But here's how it works:It quickly absorbs all the liquid from solid waste, leaving bone-dry, aroma-free little pellets. It forms large, firm clumps of liquid waste, which scoop out easily without crumbling. Somehow the clumps always reside below the dry surface. There simply is no odor. Currently I'm in a larger home, still with 2 cats, with the box in an open area just a few feet from my TV chair. I am, I admit, not very good about cleaning the box. Yet there simply is no odor.

Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,"I decided for myriad reasons to go back to DE shaving about 3 months ago. My first purchase was the Merkur 180 and it has become the standard by which I now judge other razors. Paired with Feather blades and using a 3 pass method this razor gives an extraordinary shave.I since have collected over 20 vintage Gillette razors and, so far, the only ones that may rival the Merkur are my Fat Boys( 1960 & 1961), Gold Aristocrat (1953), and perhaps my Super Speed Flare Tip red(1955) and my 1966 Slim Adjustable. Of course I haven't tried them all yet.The Merkur is nicely weighted, feels good in your hand, and gives an excellent reproducible shave. It seems to work as well on one days growth as on 2 or 3.If I had to pick just one razor to use this would be it. As an aside, do yourself a little luxury and pick up an alum block( I like the Razor Rock) to soothe and close your pores after shaving. As for shave Cream, so far I have used Proraso for sensitive skin and Taylor of Old Bond St. Both excellent products when applied with a decent badger brush.In sum, you can pay more but I'm not sure you can get a much better shave than this.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,"('health personal care', 'personal care', 'shaving hair removal')"

It combs well and I literally spend 1-2 minutes messing with it to get a good look.I highly recommend cycling between the two above and something like Coconut milk Shampoo/conditioner to maintain a balance between Thick/Matted and soft/flexible.

The problem is that sometimes the brace isn't very comfortable.

Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I just purchased this pump because I can't find some of the parts to my Medela Swing, and since I only pump to relieve engorgement, and this time very painful mastitis, I figured a manual pump was worth a try. With the last four babies, I have had, at various points, a Medela Pump in Style, a Medela Swing, and a First Years miPump, and the Medelas both worked well. But I never pumped to bottle feed, so I am not a regular pumper.All that being said, I was hesitant about the usefulness of a manual pump, but thought I'd give it a try, and I have to say I am impressed. I actually think this pump is way MORE effective than the electric pumps. With this manual pump, you can really control the rhythm, so you can match how much you pump to how much milk is actually coming out. I get way more milk way faster out of this manual pump than I ever did with my electrics. Very easy to use and not a lot of parts for cleaning and losing.Definitely would recommend this pump, especially for moms like me who don't pump all the time but just need it here and there.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,"('baby products', 'feeding', 'breastfeeding')"

The Bernese Mtn Dog got hold of a Medium size ball (he should have a large) and managed to rip it apart to get to the inner area filled with treats. One expensive dog ball, destroyed. However, this was not the right size for him, so perhaps that's why. The Coton de Tulears that I gave the small size ball to have still not finished the treat.

Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Color Creme with Fruit Oil Concentrate Hair Coloring Products,I was a lifelong Clairol user until I tried Garnier. The only reason I picked it up was it was on sale so I thought why not. While this hair color does not deliver something extaordinary the product experience is so much better. I was a little irritated that there is an extra step where you have to put in the fruit oil along with the color in the developer bottle but in the end who cares. The product is so much thicker and does not have as strong a color-at-home scent. The conditioner is also thicker and does not slide out of your hand in the shower. The color when applied looks like a thicker version of pancake batter. When I was done I realized i didn't mind coloring my hair so much. And it seems this brand is cheaper than others in store and online so I don't need to find coupons which is getting harder to do. Remember when one was included in every box? A+ rating.

Invacare IB Thumb Spica Large - X-Large,"I cut it off all the way around the wrist end to make it shorter.

I spent $60 on a leather splint from my dr's office and it's much more comfortable than this. This is neoprene, so it's not that bad, but still not as good as the leather. I also had trouble wearing this in hot weather and using Ketoprofen pain creme. I got a horrible, raised, itchy rash. I finally saw a dermatologist the second week when the rash wouldn't go away. He said neoprene is one of the top 50 allergens in the U.S., so I guess it contributed to the rash. As an experiment, I wore it in hot weather again and took it off when I noticed signs of a rash again. I can wear a wetsuit in hot weather without a problem, but then I spend most of the time in cold water in that situation.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'braces')"

"PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32""","During the last nine years, I've had six lumbar spinal surgeries, including two fusions. At this time, I have fusions at L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. What that means is that I can't bend or twist very much, and even trying to bend or twist can cause my next free disk to fail. So I have to use a reacher to pick up things. After three of my surgeries, my health insurance company provided me with a reacher, each a different model. I keep them in the house in the areas where I'm most likely to drop things.The three reachers I have now are:* The Golden Retreiver 31 Inch Reacher* PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32""* Duro-Med 32 Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic TipEach reacher works very well, and I use at least one of them almost every day. Overall, the Golden Retriever is my favorite, as well as the most used, and I think it's the sturdiest of the three. It will pick up objects up to slightly more than three inches across. It's my favorite because the design of the handle puts the pulling force in line with my arm, with every finger curling the same amount. With weak, arthritic hands, that's a real plus compared to my other reachers, which have angled pistol grips.The PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32"" is a nice reacher, but it's my least favorite one because the angled pistol grip requires quite a bit of force to pull. However, it has the widest grip of the three, with a whopping 5 inches between the pick-up tips, and it's the only one big enough to pick up the newspaper from the driveway.The Duro-Med 32 Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic Tip is a very nice reacher, and it's the most versatile of my three reachers. The magnetic tip is great for picking up small steel items like gem clips and screws (before I got this one, I took a wooden dowel and cemented a small magnet to the tip). Also, the angled pistol grip requires only a very light touch to close the jaws. Note that one of the jaws pivots on an angle, which is an advantage for some items and a disadvantage for others.------------------------------------I use each of the three reachers at least a couple of times a week, and I'm pleased with each of them. My main caveat applies to the PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32"". It requires quite a bit of force compared to the other two, so it may not be suitable for people with weak or arthritic hands.At the time I'm writing this review, Amazon sells each of the three reachers, with prices ranging from ten to twenty dollars. They're all 5-star devices in my opinion, but each excels in certain functions as well as having certain drawbacks.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,daily living aids,"('health personal care', 'medical supplies equipment', 'daily living aids')"

Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,"Best toy purchase ever!! ...Okay, maybe not EVER, but it's pretty freakin' cool. Besides coming early, I paid close attention to where everything was. It took some digging in an old junk drawer to find a screwdriver tiny enough (good thing I've saved it for the 11th Doctor's when that comes), but after five minutes of patience and care with the batteries it paid off.I have had the best time having fun with the pen (sparingly, since I want it to last), and it actually makes a decent flashlight. This was tested during Hurricane Sandy when the power went out and my flashlight went dead. I've gotten good at flipping it and catching it like the Doctor, and sometimes I stow it in my purse for days when I'm bored.To be honest, yes, it can get tiring after a while. But I bought it over seven months ago, and the batteries still work. The lights, the sounds - they all still work! And it's the best thing a fan of David Tennant's Doctor can have. :)Now, if you excuse me, I am off to run around my room with the sonic and pretend I'm having adventures with a madman in a box.",toys games,action toy figures,accessories,"('toys games', 'action toy figures', 'accessories')"

So far, it's still all in one piece which is good for him. My only issue and why this received 3 stars is because the hole on the top of the trunk is too large. If I get my dog to focus on the sides, it will take him a little big of time to remove one. But if he goes through the top, there is no struggle for him.The toy still makes a great deal having the 3 squirrels and the trunk. The trunk could be used to hold other items for the dog to remove.

Melissa & Doug Learn-To-Play Piano,"Purchased this for Christmas for a toddler and a preschooler. Both kids enjoy playing with it and even I like to tap out some of the songs from the book. It's a nice heavy structure with a glossy paint finish. I know some reviews said the top came off, but ours appears to be very firmly attached. The strip of paper that labels the keys really is just a strip of paper with a dab of glue/tape on either end. My kids took this off almost immediately, but it's easy to put back on and if you want a more secure attachment, glue the entire strip down. I actually kind of like that it can be removed giving you the option of not labeling the keys.The sound is not an amazing concert piano, obviously, but sounds like you'd expect and is not unpleasant.

We'd resigned ourselves to making her an outside kitty when I found this stuff on Amazon. It works. It works too well. Now all three cats use the one box with this specific litter in it. I've taken to just using it in all four recently. Honestly, the price isn't that bad. I was using World's Best which all the cats liked save for the problem child, but problem child didn't like any kind of litter I used sides this stuff. Whatever makes them happy makes me happy at this point and this is actually cheaper than what I was getting. I do wish Amazon had it on prime. So far, covers odor pretty well, but I clean them every time I see it needs to be done. Definitely worth trying if you have a cat that refuses to use a box.

LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,"My mother bought this for my 9 mo son as a Christmas gift. He LOVES it! I think it's a great toy overall, esp. the bilingual switch. I just thought I would warn people that it is not stable. Once we put the legs on, he pulled himself up to a standing position (which he does on a daily basis) and in a matter of minutes, he pulled the table towards himself, went flying backwards and the table came down over him and rolled across his body. He wasn't hurt, just looked a little dazed. The way we have solved the problem is to push it into a corner, so the pressure of his body pushes it towards the walls instead of pulling it towards him. It could still knock him over and roll across his body, but it is less likely to happen. He easily pushes the table along the wall as he plays with it because it just isn't stable. Being a FTM and not having a lot of experience with toys yet, I am honestly surprised this toy hasn't be recalled and/or that this problem has not been fixed.

The product works, it really does, but it doesn't provide enough moisture for my skin to keep it glowing after the peel process settles. The solution to that problem? I tried all kinds of creams- they left me feeling heavy. My friend recommended a retinol cream which I fell in love with -.

Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,"This was one of my son's favorite gifts once we finally got the poorly made track to stay together.

The plug inside the coal car for the 9.6 volt battery is not useable at all. I even took train car to Radio Shack to see if I was doing something wrong. After hours of trying to plug the battery-pack in, we finally got it! Only to find out, train won't power up at all - yes we charged the battery. So either we buy a lifetime supply of C batteries or, send it back. I was thinking about taking a chance on a second one. But after reading through some of the one-star reviews, in regard to price fluctuation on this train, maybe not.

We looked at many things - the human hair, skin, leaves, and a slide kit that had many different interesting things to look at. It says it is good for up to 18 year olds. I think it is a great starter microscope. It seems good sturdy quality and yet it is lightweight enough that is is easy for the little ones to handle.",toys games,learning education,science,"('toys games', 'learning education', 'science')"

ThinkFun Zingo,"I bought this at a local store for Christmas for my son who will turn 4 in a few months. We have played it now three times in the last few days and even my daughter who turns 2 tomorrow is able to play...and kinda good at it!Each Zingo game card has two sides, a green and a red. The red is supposed to be more challenging so we have only played the green side so far. I play the dealer, who slides the red box to reveal 2 of the yellow plastic word tags at a time. The mechanism is easy to work and both my kids can do it but it's easier if I'm the dealer to keep them from being distracted. Also the tags are difficult to slide back into the dispenser one at a time through the slots. Both kids help put them in when the lid is off - they are rounded one one end and flat on the other making it easy to see which direction they face.Play is fun and it only takes about 15 minutes for someone to win, though with two toddlers we play until everyone ""wins"". My son is just starting to read and I hope that continued play helps him with his reading to link the word with the picture. My daughter easily recognizes each picture, even ""smile"", and calls them out by name, though she is not reading at all. They don't always remember what they are looking for and sometimes call out the name of whatever tag comes up even though they don't need that to make a match, but again I love the reinforcement of the picture names and words.My husband hasn't played this with us yet because we've played it while he's at work but I love that this is a game we can all play as a family. I look forward to a family game night!Santa brought us Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land too. Chutes and ladders was confusing and disinteresting to the 2 yr old and took the 4 yr old quite a few turns before he kinda got the idea. It didn't hold their attention. Candyland was more fun and very easy for both to understand since there is no counting involved. They did great, but the 2 year old again got distracted and left before game was over.

VTech - Move & Crawl Electronic Activity Ball,"First off, let me say that I'm not a big reviewer. I usually only leave reviews if I love it or if I hate it. I LOVE this ball, and so does my baby! First off, it has volume control, two distinctive levels that truly are different. On the lower level, it still entertains my son without waking my sleeping husband, who works nights. Also, the buttons are so sensitive that my 3-month-old son can press them and make it sing. His face lights up when this ball sings! The voice is super-cute! The ball rolls and rolls all around. It works better on the hardwoods, doesn't go very far on the rug, but I bet it would do well in a playpen. My son cannot crawl yet, but he tries his hardest to get to the ball during his tummy time; it actually occupies him during tummy time so he stays down there a little longer. We also use it to practice sitting him up, as he sits up and presses the buttons and moves the ladybug on the top of the ball for a good 10 minutes (which is GREAT for him!).

Revivogen Shampoo and Conditioner Value Pack,"Having a Father and two older brothers that went completely bald by the age of 20, I was conscious about my hair from a very young age. Over the years I have literally tried just about every shampoo, conditioner, styling product and supplement on the market. With Revivogen, 5% Rogain Foam, 1mg daily of Finasteride and Aveda Grooming Clay (for daily styling) I have finally found the perfect combination in fighting hair loss. At age 35, my hair is finally back to being just as thick as when I was 16 (full head of hair). I even use Rogaine on my temples and frontal hair line and it's always worked very well for me (initial shedding phase takes patience, don't give up!).As others have mentioned, this product does dry out he scalp a little bit, so be sure to use Nizoral once or twice a week to fight dandruff (it's also good for battling hair loss). My Wife tends to have thinning hair in her upper scalp region and it gets really bad when she uses store brands (diluted garbage and is sure to contribute to hair loss). Since she's been using Revivogen shampoo and conditioner her hair is full, shiny and you can't see through to her scalp even in the sunlight like before.

1/24 RC 3-Ch Remote Control M1A2 Abrams Tank,"I bought this primarily for indoor play. Turns out it's not really suitable for it - at least not in my house. The instructions warn against using it on carpet! We still checked it out, to try and decide if we wanted a similar toy that worked on carpet, or one of the alternatives. For that little bit, it worked ok. No problems with tread loss that others reported. The BB gun loaded and fired as per the instructions. There were some reception problems, but it's not clear if that was range or interference from a nearby computer. If it was a radio range, it was maybe 15 feet, which would be a serious issue outdoors.The things that set this one apart from the others we had considered were all disappointments. The choice came down to one of the BB-firing tanks with an canon that could be elevated, or an IR canon with a life counter of some kind suitable for simulating battles. The BB gun fires at sufficient velocity that tracking shots inside is nearly impossible, so we're not going to look for another of those. The gun elevation isn't really controllable. There's one button that elevates it to the top of the (rather limited) range, then lowers it to the bottom, then back up, and so on, instead of one button for up and one for down. Sort of pointless, and not at all fun. The demo mode is mildly amusing, but hitting the button by accident while trying to go forward happened sufficiently often that leaving off the demo feature would have been an improvement.Driving the tank itself was also a bit of a loss. While the motors driving the treads have two speeds in both directions, you can't really use all the possibilities. Turning is limited to one tread going while the other is still (basically pivoting around the still tread) or having them go in opposite directions (spinning in place). While having two rates of spin seems a little pointless, having the ability to shift one tread into high gear while the other stays at normal speed - resulting in a turn while moving forward - would have been a major improvement in the toy.The programming aspect looked like it might be fun, but that was a bust as well. It doesn't move while recording a program, so you can't tell what it's doing. When you record a move, pressing a button triggers the selected action for a preset amount of time, which you can't change by, for instance, holding down the button. The turns come out at almost 180 degrees. You can't even replicate the demo mode programs with it.I seriously considered giving this tank one star, but it wasn't broken or completely useless out of the box - just where I wanted to use it. So it gets two stars, with a warning about not using it in most houses.",toys games,hobbies,radio control,"('toys games', 'hobbies', 'radio control')"

ApHogee Two Step Protein Treatment,"Ok, so I've been using this stuff for three weeks now, (I'm african american & wash my hair weekly) & I've really noticed a difference.I've had years of coloring & relaxing my hair, so I've had dry hair, split ends, & constant breakage. My hair never seemed to grow past shoulder length. Health & hair care professionals say you're supposed to shed like 100 hairs a day, but I'm noticing that my hair sheds far less than that, if it sheds at all.After the first usage, my hair felt stronger. I usually air dry my hair & then flat iron it. Usually, when the flat iron neared my split ends, hair would start to break. Now, my hair feels stronger & like it doesn't &#34;give&#34; as easily.You have to follow the instructions when using this product and I'd recommend applying it in the shower, to keep the mess to a minimum. If you fully coat your hair, the product will run, so you're going to want to wrap your neck in a towel. Try to wrap your hair or have it up, without something holding it up. You could sit for 40 min & let this stuff air dry, but when using this product, I just blow dry my hair on a medium setting. As your hair begins to dry, it will still look wet, but it will become very hard. Be careful not to agitate your hair or try to comb through it, or you'll risk breakage. After your hair is dry, simply hop back in the shower, gently wash the treatment out & apply a deep conditioner -- then you're done!",beauty,hair care,hair scalp treatments,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'hair scalp treatments')"

Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,"I've been using Naturtint for years. I tried various shades over the years including Dark Blonde, Dark Golden Blonde, Light Brown, etc. They always turned out too dark---sometimes almost black--but I just lived with it since after about 2 weeks or so, it lightened enough that it was tolerable. My hair is naturally a light to med brown with some gray mixed with it. On Christmas day, I decided I needed to color my hair before I went anywhere, so I had bought this shade to try. I figured it's either do or die because it was the only thing on-hand and all the stores were closed. (You know that feeling, right?) So...I mixed it up and took my wide-tooth comb and combed some through the front to do the strand test. I then rinsed and dried it and was very pleased so I went for it. It's a nice honey brown on me and it leaves the hair in great condition, very shiny. It doesn't burn your scalp or have the strong smells the other hair colors have, although those are good to have if someone's prone to fainting, needs to be revived and there are no ammonia capsules available. Try just one box of Naturtint and you won't be sorry. I hightly recommend the Naturtint Shampoo and Conditioner, the companion products that go with the color.",beauty,hair care,hair color,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'hair color')"

Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,I purchased this for my 7 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He is a busy guy who likes to figure out how things go together and work.

He has played with it for several days (literally all day). He checks off the experiments he has done in the booklet and he has been able to come up with new experiments and new ways to make the light bulb go on. There are still so many experiments for him to do and I know he will enjoy this toy for some time. The nice thing is that there is not a zillion pieces to this so it's not overwhelming and so far the only thing he has needed not included in the kit was 2 AA batteries.

PetAg KMR 2nd Step Kitten Weaning Food 14oz,"My cat has had serious problems over the last few years with gum/dental problems, and lost quite a bit of weight in the process of diagnosing and treating him. After we got the infection cleared up, his appetite was still shaky due to his association of food with pain - he was even unable to eat canned food without screaming until we got his teeth removed and the infection cleared up. My vet recommended mixing a scoop of this in with his foods and a cup or so of water to entice his appetite. It amazingly worked like a charm. He's back up to his normal 13 lb self, his coat is glossy and soft again, and his eyes are bright. Even though he's 12, he's playing like a kitten again. I know that resolving the infection had quite a bit to do with that, but if we weren't able to get him eating again, it would still be a long battle ahead.Make sure to get your cat's teeth cleaned on a regular basis - I've had 2 so far that have had this same issue, and it's a nasty infection to get rid of :(",pet supplies,cats,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'health supplies')"

Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord,"My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.

Melissa & Doug Shape Sorting Cube,"I loved the idea of a wooden toy - durable, high quality, etc. I have gotten my daughter a number of toys from various wooden toy makers and European toy makers. I ordered this shape sorter and am not happy with the product. The newer version (we got this for Xmas 2012) has a plywood box, and it is unfinished. I don't have a problem with unfinished wood or plywood, except many of the box's edges (outside and within the shape holes themselves) are poorly cut and VERY jagged. It is unpleasant to touch, but the biggest problem of course is that it can give you splinters. SPLINTERS! Really, Melissa and Doug?

We don't know if he may have ingested the part. Haven't noticed any squeaky flatulence, so I think we're good. As for our flat-faced little dogs, this is an ideal toy because they can get it their mouth. They can't sqeak them on their own so we assist them.

"PAIR of Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Braces with Dorsal Stay, Black , Left & Right","These are long term wearer braces.They support really well, and fit me, approx 150 lb. 5'11&#34; male very well.Neoprene-esque cloth is nice and soft, and keeps the wrists warm and the muscles relaxed.Metal is very solid and has that firm support needed.Velcro and straps are very good and provide a tight fit without scratching or irritating.Can be used while performing other activites, though not exercise, as this is not the primary focus of the product.Can be used while typing, but not the best for typing.The only issue I have with these are sometimes I wear my braces, and i like to take them on and off often (between meals, etc.) This pair is very hard to get on and off because of how secure and how many velcro latches there are. In some instances i find myself pinching my wrist briefly trying to pull up the two back velcro latches. The main velcro latch is perfect though.

All Purpose Cleaner Degreaser 32 Ounces,"I've been using this cleaner for years and we have gotten to the point where BioKleen All Purpose is the only cleaner we have in the house. I use it for EVERYTHING - kitchen counters, oven/stove, toilet, tub/showers, tile floors, walls, carpet, glass. The only other cleaner I use is some diluted Murphy's Oil Soap for wood and Lysol Spray for raw meat spillage (because I don't want to take risks with that). Otherwise, it's BioKleen All Purpose all the way!!I have 2 All Purpose spray bottles purchased years ago and now I just dilute the concentrate and refill the bottles as needed. One for the kitchen, one for the bathrooms. I love it so much that I've since expanded into laundry products, fabric refresher, dishwashing supplies, drain cleaner, etc. We cloth diaper and have 2 large dogs and the Bac-Out in particular has been a lifesaver. Everything has a light, clean, NATURAL smell... so when you're cleaning, you get the feeling you're hanging out in an orange grove instead of a chemical plant. My favorite is the Lemon Thyme fabric refresher. Amazing!!The only thing I've found that I don't like is the Produce Wash, and that's only because we despise the smell of licorice.I do wish they would create a line of biodegradable, disposable wipes for on-the-go, like diaper bags or for quick clean ups around the house. I like to wipe down restaurant eating surfaces before my kids touch them, so for now I use a small spray bottle with the diluted All Purpose spray and wipe with some of their cloth diaper wipes, and it works like a charm.",health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning,"('health personal care', 'household supplies', 'household cleaning')"

Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,"Bought this as a gift for my grandchild, keep in mind I have bought/collected Lionel trains for over 50 years, for Christmas. I started out a couple months back with Thomas set to see how he would take care of it. Since he did very well I decided to move him up to the ""O"" gauge Polar Express since he was infatuated with the movie, etc. We set it up on Christmas Day and it was a treat for all until about 1 hr later it stopped working. I called Lionel the next day and explained the symptoms to wit they said the engine was shorted and needed repair. I could send it in and get it back in 3 or 4 weeks, bring it locally for repair (2 months) or return it for a refund. I decided to return it and order a replacement. Received my replacement from AMAZON the next day (THEY ARE THE GREATEST!!!!!) and have shipped the old one back for refund.It is really too bad that these have to be made in China now because they are nowhere near the quality of what we expect from Lionel. The box says they are located in Chesterfield, IL but I have been there and there are only maybe 3 people left at that facility. Most personnel are now located in N. Carolina, and Ohio. Another American industry, known for high quality, now producing inferior goods outside the USA. LIONEL, Inc,,,,please get your act together and bring the quality back to the model train industry and make these in the US.I am hoping this was an fluke but I see others who have experienced issues. When they work it is great....time will tellI would be real sad if it were not for the customer service at Amazon. BTW, the customer service at Lionel was very prompt and courteous too. If yours works these are a great choice. I gave it 3 stars because I expected, for the price, that this train would be QC'd and work. Here's hoping that this unit lasts many years. I have other Lionels that are over 70 years old and running great....I don't think these new units are up to that longevity.

Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap,"I bought this wrap for my 15-lb Bichon Frise as a last resort before crating. He's 7 years old, and is house broken, but developed separation anxiety after I went back to work in March and started marking all over our furniture and making our home smell like urine. We tried the sprays and everything else and he continued to do this. Everyone kept telling us to crate him during the day but I really didn't want to do that because he's never had to be in a crate and I knew it would upset him a lot. I saw this wrap on Amazon when I was researching doggy diapers, and thought I'd give it a try. I read the reviews, some of which said to put a maxi pad in the wrap before putting it on the dog so I bought a jumbo pack with wings and change it out a couple of times a day. I bought an additional wrap so I can alternate them when washing one (2-3 times a week). The maxi pads do bunch up sometimes, so the wrap will get urine on it, but it doesn't leak out of the wrap (I just need to wash the wrap then).

POSTURE-PRO Adjustable Double Diner,"I ordered two of these for my dogs - we have a newfoundland and a mastiff. One of them came with three missing screws on one leg (where the leg is attached to the top) - and when I found the screws loose in the box and attempted to screw them in myself, I discovered that the screws were stripped. Which is probably why they fell out. I was able to replace with three slightly larger screws of my own, but the legs on both are still pretty wobbly when fully extended. The previous reviews I read said that this product was very sturdy, so I don't know if mine was poorly put together.We're going to attempt to stabilize and made them less wobbly, because the price is really good, and these are the perfect height for my dogs.

Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,"This was one of my first purchases as a homeowner....I decided on this item based on a few other wonderful reviews. It really does deliver. I have a larger dog, and I find this scoop can handle the ""situation."" I find it slides right under the business, without ripping all the grass up. I suggest it for anyone who has a yard and a dog... I would certainly replace this with an identical product if it broke, or was lost, or stolen, or destroyed in an act of God.Now that winter has appeared in the mid-west, I have discovered that the ""Wire rake scooper for grass"" is really best on the grass. Not the greatest on frozen ground...does OK on snow, but sort of useless on the hard earth, it can't get underneath the business. I think I'll have to consider another type for the winter.

Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,"I used to use the claw-type pooper scoopers, and I really like them, but they tend to only last 3-9 months before the plastic breaks apart. I was looking to see if there was a metal version, and I came across this one. The photo was a little unclear, so I thought it was a claw-type like my old ones, just made of metal instead. It's not. It's a rake, single-sided, and I expected to hate it. Surprisingly, I kind of like it. The rake is angled so that poop stays in it until you're ready to dump it into a bag. In some ways, it's more efficient than the old plastic claw-type scoops, in that it can pick up more in one swoop. My only complaints are (1) the tines do tend to get stuck in grass sometimes (or, in my case, on the threads binding the large swaths of artificial turf in my backyard), and (2) the handle is a little uncomfortable after scooping for a while. For the second half of the yard, I had to alternate hands because mine were getting sore from the handle. Aside from that, I like it, and expect that it will last longer than my other ones (fingers crossed).",pet supplies,dogs,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'litter housebreaking')"

It drys my thick, medium length,colored hair very quickly.We liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall). Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell. My husband said I should have kept the air intake a bit cleaner. Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life span.We just finished remodeling our master bathroom and no longer want a wall-mountable unit, so it is being installed in the guest bathroom.

Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,"First of all I have to say...if you CAN use a regular blade razor with shaving cream, soap, or what have you, DO IT! An electric razor will *NEVER* shave as close as a regular blade razor (nope, no totally silky soft skin), nor will you shave as quickly, so stop looking at electric razors to save time...because you won't.What I wouldn't give to be able to use a blade razor. Unfortunately, my skin is ultra-sensitive and every time I try to shave my legs with a blade razor they itch so much after about 30 minutes that only drawing blood will get me to stop scratching my legs (no matter what moisturizer I use), and I don't even want to think about the ingrown hairs that develop after a couple of days. I've tried everything for ""after-shave"" to help...from Tend Skin to exfoliation...and nothing works for me. So, I'm stuck using electric razors.If there's a better electric razor out there for women, I have not found it. I've tried at least ten different ones and this is, by FAR, the best that I've tried. It's the closest shave I've found in an electric, doesn't pull at all unless I'm going WAY too fast, has never nicked me once, and really hugs my legs because of the pivoting head. I've had my Panasonic razor for probably three years, and the rechargeable battery is still kicking. I still get at least 30 minutes out of it on a charge. It was at least 45 when I first got it! OK, so I have to go over some spots twice to get all of the hair...oh well! I can definitely live with that, and I've had the same problem with every other electric I've used.

My hair was already reasonably bright purple, and has been purple for 8 months now, it is even bleached, I just wanted to touch it up since a few spots had faded. I bought 2 bottles and put it on, I even let it sit for 4 HOURS, and it looks EXACTLY the same. It didn't even cover the faded spots. This color of dye is definitely the worst Special Effects Dye I've used, it was more watery as I spread it through my hair, and like someone else said, more like a glaze.

Vo-toys Rubber Tug Toy 13 Length,"My dog loves playing tug. I had been buying the rope tugs, but I couldn't afford them at the rate she was going through them.

This was the first one I bought, and I chose it because it was relatively cheap. I didn't want to spend a lot on a toy that might not work out for us.To my delight, this tug toy was perfect, a great value and the item I will buy again when it comes time to replace it. My dog loves it as much as her ropes, although there was an adjustment period, and she can't destroy it quickly.

I was on a warm weather holiday, so I was wear sandals and not wearing socks too often at all. These really need more support to stay put. I did, of course, use surgical tape too.

Precision Gyroscope (colors may vary),"I bought this for my children recently, and was fairly disappointed; I specifically spent a few extra dollars on the ""precision"" model gyroscope, as better rotation and balance would allow more time for exploring the possibilities of gyroscopic motion, thus giving the kids more time to find fun things to do.Unfortunately, ""precision"" is not a word I would use to describe this toy out of the box.The first time I spun the gyroscope -- using the included toothed ripcord -- I noticed that the gyroscope was extremely noisy and vibrated a lot. I then tried spinning the gyroscope with a piece of string, but the string became caught between the pivot points (screws that penetrate the colored frame) and the rotor axis, causing it to jam, and resulting in my having to cut the string into pieces to extract it.Upon inspecting the axis of rotation I noticed some plastic flash on the rotor axis (left over from the casting process) so I trimmed that off with a hobby knife; the noise was significantly reduced, but the gyroscope still seemed unbalanced and noisy for a ""precision"" instrument. I then noticed that there was some play between the rotor and the pivot screws; this was the reason the thing ate my string",toys games,learning education,science,"('toys games', 'learning education', 'science')"

"New-Skin Liquid Bandage, First Aid Liquid Antiseptic, Over 50 Applications, 0.3 Fluid Ounce","***This is not a scientific study, all evidence presented is anecdotal. ***I have now used New Skin twice on relatively large burns and abrasions with amazing results. Once was road rash after a bicycle race (~ 6 square inches over three wounds). The second was second and third degree burns from a camp fire (~ 4 square inches in two wounds).The road rash healed with almost no scarring, despite being deep enough to burn through the skin and subcutaneous fat.The burns are currently doing well, though it has only been a week and they have not healed completely.I have not been able to find many details about using New Skin on wounds this large. I don't know if it is safe, or even a good idea, but it seems to work.I have used both the spray and the brush applicator form of this product. The spray form is much easier to use and the liquid form is cheaper per application.In both cases, I did not apply New Skin for hours or days after the injury occurred. When applying I cleaned the wound with an aniceptic wash and allowed it to air dry. After it was dry I applied an even coat over the entire area and a 5-10mm border around the wound. It formed an artificial scab. I reapplied twice a day to fill in cracks and maintain the border. If you reapply a full coat each time you end up with a huge accumulation after a few weeks (1-3mm).The artificial scabs are transparent, so you ( and everyone around you if you're lucky enough to wound your hand) will be delighted with a view of what I believe is a mixture of plasma, platelets and blood. It looks like puss, but I think it's the liquid that dries to form real scabs (sometimes I spring a leak and it dries into a scab).

Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,"My eyelashes aren't long, but aren't really too short either. They stick straight down so I've tried many curling products and this works best for me.The brush that came with it to clean any mascara off (since it is recommended to use after applying mascara)is great! It also cleans my eyelash comb or seperater really well. If you don't do this carefully you can curl your eyelashes in a really weird way which happened a couple times at first.It said not to use when wearing contacts, but when I use it before wearing contacts, then put my contacts in my eyelashes get a little wet and then my eyelashes go straight down again not to mention that there is some mascara on too. I tried using it while wearing contacts since you put on mascara before using the curler and it was fine. Contact wearers I'm not sure if it is 100% safe using it with your contacts in but I took a leap of faith and I think it's fine. Everybody is different so this might not work on some people's eyelashes. The one problem about this is that batteries need to be replace A LOT. This curler devours double A batteries within a week or two, but if you don't use it everyday it should last longer before the battery drains.Overall it works for me so I am happy with my purchase.",beauty,tools accessories,makeup brushes tools,"('beauty', 'tools accessories', 'makeup brushes tools')"

We hold the dog's head and massage the base of the ear for about 30 seconds to loosen the wax. Let the dog shake it out and break it up (may want to do this outside if there's a lot of build up).

Per the advice of the pet store expert, I bought regular human pantie liners and cut them down to go inside. This garment was the smallest and most discrete, yet we never had any problems. Puppy did not object to it and comes readily to me when I am holding it, as long as she gets her treat! Rinses easily.

"Petmate Ultimate Litter Scoop 22972, Colors may Vary","I scoop three litter boxes daily - many times twice daily. I use Swheat Scoop litter. This is the best scooper I've used so far. While the handle could be a tad bit longer, it is long enough for not too much bending on my part. The material is strong enough to scoop to the bottom of the litter box and pull up any clumped litter clinging to the bottom of the box easily.The scoop strainer has large enough holes so that the litter sifts more quickly (so I don't have to spend forever shaking the scooper to separate the clumps and let the unused litter fall through.) I can see how some folks can say the holes are too big, but for my kitties' droppings, this is perfect.Mine came in the blue color, which i liked because it matches the litter box ... but really not a big deal. I really appreciate it.I also use the Litter Genie (bought in pet store - not online). I like the Litter Genie because it keeps the litter discard smells trapped. The size was better when I only scooped one box, but with three, it tends to fill up fast. I've jerry-rigged the top half of the Litter Genie to sit on top of a taller garbage container so the bag can extend longer and catch more discard. Works for me so far. I highly recommend the Litter Genie to help with smells. i have a sensitive nose and no longer smell box odors when I walk in my small apartment.

Boy am I glad I took his advice.The driving force behind NO-Xplode, and all NO Boosters, is an amino acid called L-Arginine. This is what really pumps the blood into the muscles and gives you that pumped feeling. I've been actually adding straight L-Arginine (L Arginine (1 Kg) (2.2 Lbs) Bulk Powder) into the Xplode and have taken things to whole another level.

Salon Bronze Airbrush Tanning System,Bought this because my friend swore it was great. I had my boyfriend apply it in the shower it applied terribly the nozzle is terrible and it came out watery and kept running everytime we sprayed. To get my entire body what I thought was evenly it took an entire cartridge. I waited 24 hrs and saw I was spotty. If it sprayed correctly I would like it. I had to also rub most of it in lightly with a paper towel bc i was covered in dripping brown liquid.Be careful when spraying ur feet I didn't put much on them and they still came out blotchy orange. You are literally paying for a plastic gun that pushes on the nozzle of the bottle to get it to come out and the tanner. This is not something u can spray by yourself. Make sure you do it in the tub bc it is messy but washes off without a problem. Also it has that typical self tanner smell which I don't mind but some people do. It will stain your nails so be careful with them.

Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We purchased this swing in 2009 for our first baby, mainly because it was one of the only ones available at the time that plugged into the wall. Three years and two babies later it's still working like new and I'm giving it to my sister for her new baby. The cover is easily removed and washes beautifully, the little mobile animals can be spot cleaned. It's pretty quiet, but it does have a bit of motor noise- both my kids actually found that soothing. There are variable volume settings, as well as different music and rainforest noises. The mobile also has an independent on and off switch, which was nice when I wanted the mobile on for them to look at, but not the music. It's easily taken apart for storage, but it's not a great option for a lot of car transport, as it's pretty big. We set it up in a quiet corner of our family room and occasionally moved it around the house. It does fold up to get through doors, so moving it throughout the house is no problem.

"Frownies Forehead & Between Eyes, 144 Patches",This product comes in a small neatly packaged box with instructions. The product itself is unbleached natural kraft paper with a natural water based adhesive. There are 144 pieces. I bought these to help prevent those vertical forehead lines . I usually just have to remind myself to relax my face or do a simple facial massage massage. However sometimes my forehead scrunches up automatically and I don't realize it. I wouldn't mind wearing these around the house during the day but bought them mainly for nighttime use. Because they are something you cannot cover up with makeup. I do sleep on my stomach so I also thought they might help with the sleeping on the face wrinkles. They are very simple to use. Make sure you have a clean face. Then take one or two or how ever many you need off of the perforated stack and dampen one at a time to activate the adhesive and place in desired spot(s). Be sure to press down for a few seconds or more to ensure a good stick. Perhaps I did not wet the product enough before putting them on as the very tips of the corners stuck up a little bit. Or it could jut be the stiffness of the product in conjunction with my forehead shape. I do know that Frownies has a rose water spray for activating the adhesive. They also have other shapes for different parts of the face. Overall I like the product and would recommend it to family and friends as a simple at home way to help keep facial muscles from creating unwanted creases.,beauty,skin care,face,"('beauty', 'skin care', 'face')"

Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,This pet toy is very cute. I showed it off to a couple of different friends and they both immediately ordered one from Amazon. The quality is excellent. Very detailed construction. The squirrels/chipmunks whatever you prefer are adorable. Our dog is a 70 pound German short hair that lives to tear all of the stuffing out of every toy we buy her. Immediately!! Most toys last less than an hour and then she carries around the pelt. She's been playing with these since Christmas and only this evening decided to rip into one of the squirrels but didn't really finish the job. He (the squirrel) is just sort of gimpy at the moment and holding on to a &#34;shred&#34; of his former self. She does like to chew on the lip of the stump now and then. Which I don't really think the manufacturer had in mind but she completely ignores me when I tell her that. Not sure how long it will last. Good product. We got it on sale before Christmas so good price as well.,pet supplies,dogs,toys,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'toys')"
"Senseo Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)","The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach.

I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era.

Hanae Mori HM,"I first encountered this fragrance as a sampler and initially disliked it. It has a sweet character but not as abrasive as, say, Angel Man---similar but not quite as in your face and not as chemical. The top citrus notes are fresh and there is no getting around the overall complexity of the elements, especially the florals. Excellent longevity with a somewhat feminine dry down. Avoid over application so that you are not a scent 'bomb' for the first hour.This cologne, more-so than any other I've tried, evokes physical responses from people. They will either love it and want to 'eat you up' or they will look at you funny and perhaps sic a pit-bull on you.Good luck.

"Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count","I bought this little hand pump when my oldest son was a couple weeks old and I was unable to nurse on one breast. I pumped that side everytime I nursed my son on the other, and it kept up my supply perfectly- there was no struggle when I was able to nurse on that side again. I've been looking into electric pumps (I'm not thrilled about my bulky/uncomfortable Medela pump-in-style) because this time around I want to build a bigger freezer stash, and I am considering buying a second Lansinoh hand pump because it just works so much better/faster. I just pumped 5 oz in about 10 minutes, which would take me just as long with my electric, pumping BOTH sides (as opposed to just one with the hand pump). This is a great little pump, inexpensive, and really easy to clean.Others commented about too many parts and/or too hard to dry-- perhaps it is the case, BUT I have talked with friends and with my own pumps, this is the case with ALL pumps. The reality here is that this Lansinoh pump is easy to disassemble and clean. and it really is NOT that hard to dry and it's not that time consuming (this means a lot as I have a 3 month old and a 16 month old- my time is precious).I also occasionally get hand cramps, but I suspect that would be the case with any/all manual pumps. I wouldn't fault Lansinoh on this at ALL.The soft shield that goes over the horn makes pumping so much more comfortable- no nipple pain or soreness at ALL.This pump is perfect for Stay-at-home moms who are looking to build a freezer stash. I haven't worked, but I imagine it would be quite perfect in the workplace as well... it's quiet and relatively small... and EFFICIENT.Love this pump- GREAT job Lansinoh.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,"('baby products', 'feeding', 'breastfeeding')"

It still runs, but I would be better off using a water fountain at a park. Besides that and the small reservoir, which I expected, and the crow bar you need to detach the reservoir from the unit when you need to refill, it is fine.

"LB Jamison's Regular Soup Base, Chicken Flavored, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)","You might think you have to be a culinary professional to need 6 jars of soup base in your pantry, but you haven't tried Jamison's yet. My kids are carbovores and eat a diet of pasta and rice; I add a spoonful of Jamison's to the cooking liquid. I make soup from leftover meats and vegetables and always make my stock with this product. I have tried other brands when I couldn't find Jamison's, but none compare. When I could no longer find any merchant who carried this, I tried to get my local store to stock it, but had no luck. Once, when travelling, I saw Jamison's Soup Base on a grocery store shelf and grabbed several jars. Not wanting anyone to steal them from my luggage, I put them in my carry-on. Sadly, maddening-ly, airport security called the contents liquid (trust me, it's a powder) and wouldn't let me take it on board. I had to leave it behind. It makes me sad to remember that.I suppose you think that you will not use 6 jars of soup base, but you might, once you see how versatile it is. It will keep for, well, I don't know, but a long time, and the best part is that is will make several times over what a heavy, space-hogging can of chicken broth can produce.

Excel Double Clip Extra Hands With Magnifier,"I seldom write reviews, this is probably my first review on Amazon in the last five years I've been frequently using Amazon.When I initially opened the box, I found a small ""Helping Magnifier"" box that was already in rough shape. Upon opening the box, all the components (including the magnifying glass) were loosely tossed into the bag. (see pic)First thing I did; inspect the magnifying glass. It is definitely usable, but chips or simply poor manufacturing are evident all along the edges.Next up was the ""circular"" metal band for the magnifying glass (see pic). I managed to wedge the magnifier in pretty good but there is a noticeable crookedness to it. Perhaps the difficultly in assembling this component was on my behalf but the damage to the parts themselves is inexcusable for something ""new"".Lastly, assembling the actual unit requires a ""Helping Hand"" itself. Although relatively straight forward, there are no directions (but like I said, it's clear what to do.)I am giving this product one star for now but if it performs well despite the initial complaints, I may be willing to give it two stars for how cheap it was.EDIT",toys games,hobbies,model building kits tools,"('toys games', 'hobbies', 'model building kits tools')"

Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,"My cat seems to really enjoy this new fountain and it excels in all the important areas:* Holds a large quantity of water. For my 9-pound cat, I probably only need to refill it every two weeks.* Features a replaceable charcoal filter to keep the water clean.* Operation of the pump is quiet and the water doesn't continuously make a loud ""splashing"" sound. It is audible periodically depending on the wave patterns inside of the bowl but it's actually a pleasant sound.* Straightforward to disassemble and clean and comes with detailed instructions on how to do so. I've taken it apart once so far and it took about 10 minutes to give it a thorough cleaning. There is also a set of brushes you can purchase to make cleaning a bit easier although they aren't required.* Downloadable instruction manual on manufacturer's web site if - like me - you hate keeping piles on manuals in a closet somewhere.Overall this is a nice fountain and I'm hoping it's reliable and lasts for the long haul.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'feeding watering supplies')"

Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,"I originally purchased this in September of 2012. I was extremely excited to get the unit as I had read all the reviews and I wanted to see how my 3 amigos would react. The unit was simple to set up and I had the unit running in no time. Oh, I highly recommend the Drinkwell Platinum fountain matDrinkwell Platinum Fountain Mat, MAT-D2for this unit. I did purchase the mat the day I purchased the unit and I can tell you it is a lifesaver. My kittehs took to playing in the water and some did spill out. The mat caught all the water and kept my laminate flooring from being damaged in any way at all. The mat also fits the unit perfectly and looks like it belongs with the unit. Ok, back to the 3 amigos. They simply love this fountain. At first they were typical kittehs. They walked around for a bit and would stare, and then act as if it were not there. Finally they would get close, and then jump back when one of my kids made a loud noise. Once they got over the newness they tried it. They have not looked back since. They all love it. I have one kitteh who thinks he is a raccoon and brings his food over to the fountain to be cleaned. Ok, ok, it is to play with the food in the water, but cleaning it sounds better. I have another little dude who uses his paws to draw the water from the waterfall to his mouth, and this is how he drinks. My other kitteh just likes to lap the water out of the bowl area. So I do have a little bit of experience with 3 different types of drinkers. Here is a rundown of things that may be of concern for those who are considering purchasing this fountain.Will the cats use it? I was concerned about 1 of my kittehs. He is kind of looney and I was worried this may be something he would have nothing to do with. My concerns were without merit as he was the first to try it out. All my kittehs love this fountain. Now, when I clean it, they follow me around and meow until I put it back on the floor for them to use. They have claimed their fountain and do not like me taking it away. They won't bother with a simple bowl anymore.How long do the filters last? I have 3 kittehs with the habits I listed above. My filter changes run around 4-6 weeks. I tried cleaning the filter, but it did not work. I watch amazon's prices and purchase filters when they are on sale at a decent price. You can either purchase them in packets of 3Drinkwell Fountain Premium Replacement Filter 3 packor in bulk where you get 4 packets of 3Drinkwell Platinum Premium Filters, 12-Pack. Prices vary so you have to watch. One day it is cheaper to purchase just one pack of 3 and on others it is cheaper to purchase 4 packs of 3. Keep your eyes open. As far as the filters go, if you don't change them then the water simply runs over the top of the filter and into the basin. You can still use the unit; it just won't filter the water.What are the filters made of? The filters are a formed trapezoid of fibrous material which is likely what is used for fish tank filtration. The filters will only take out foreign material such as hair or dirt so it will not circulate into the water fountain continuously. The filters will not take out any heavy metals or minerals. It is a basic sediment filter only with a light carbon backing and some carbon granules between both the front and back to remove odor. How much odor is removed, I cannot attest to, as I have a filter on my sink and do not use straight tap water for the fountain. However, from my experience in fish tank filtration I would say it is adequate.Ease of use? I have had absolutely no problems with the unit. It is very easy to put together. Once you understand how to change the reservoir it is a snap. Just remember that the reservoir cap has the plunger on it so you do not spill any water when you put the full reservoir back on the unit. You must hold the plunger out as you are tipping the reservoir over so it does not spill. Once you have it over and you are lowering the reservoir onto the fountain the plunger will be pushed up as it is lowered and then the water will be able to flow from the reservoir into the fountain basin.Cleaning? I have not had any of the problems cleaning that others have mentioned. I went to Wal-mart and purchased a dish cleaning brush that was to be dedicated to cleaning this unit. I have not had any problems reaching every area except one. The one area I need a long small cylindrical brush for is the tube from the pump to the top of the filtration basin. However, you can clean that area with a paper towel and a thin Phillips screwdriver if you had to. So cleaning really was a breeze. I would recommend that you are careful when cleaning the reservoir. Do not drop it or it may crack. By drop, I mean do not drop it from a standing position onto a hard floor. Dropping it in the sink won't crack it. The plastic is thick and seems to very durable.Water Noise? Noise has never been an issue. We keep the unit in our kitchen, which is near our living room. We have never had any annoying noise from the unit that disturbs us in any way. If you are a person who has to have utter silence at all times, then you would not like this anymore than another item that has running water. You can turn the unit up to the highest setting and you may think the unit sounds like a small running brook. If that is annoying to you then do not purchase this unit as it is a fountain with running water. Not sure what you would expect from such a unit?Motor Noise? I have never heard the motor at all, except on one occasion. The reviews mentioning the motor noise are either running the unit dry or have a bad motor. You should not hear a motor like this running. If you do then you have something wrong. Also, check your plastic pre-filter. I did hear an odd noise from my motor one time 6 days after I had put the unit down. The problem was that my longhaired kitteh, who loves to put his paws in the water, had clogged the pre-filter with his hair. It was causing the motor to have to strain, thus the noise. I simply cleaned the pre-filter and all was well.Leaking? This unit is molded as a single reservoir that sits upon a molded basin. Unless you have a crack in your unit, it should not leak. The first time I Put the reservoir down I was not careful and I allowed water to run into the unit before I put the reservoir all the way down. As I already had the basin full, this caused the basin to overflow and to stay high until the reservoir emptied. My mistake and I never made it again. Thus, I never had water over the sides again, unless my kittehs are playing in the water, which is kind of the point of having this. That brings up another point. How many of the people complaining about leaking have simply not realized their kittehs are now playing in the water which in turn has the water coming over the sides looking as if the basin is leaking? The whole point in purchasing this type of fountain is to encourage your kittehs to drink more water. I also purchased this unit as a way to allow the kittehs to play in the water more. Many cats in the wild prefer to drink from running water. There are different theories as to why, but the fact remains that they do. It is part of our kittehs past to seek out running water. Only when we domesticated them did they have to settle for sedentary water dishes. By giving our little friends these fountains we give them one more natural way for them to act. Once they get used to it, they will enjoy it more and more, and likely make more of a mess. If your unit does leak, and you know for sure your kittehs are not enjoying the fountain in a playful way, you likely have a crack.I highly recommend this pet fountain to anybody who has small to medium sized pets. I purchased a second unit from Amazon.com's Warehouse Deals when I saw the price of a used-like new unit drop to 33.00.Enjoy! And as my 3 amigos say, ""Meow, meooooooow meow, and mrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreow!""",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'feeding watering supplies')"

Assembly was easy - maybe 45 minutes or so.

Neckpro Cervical Traction Device - Adjustable Door Bracket Model - Cervical Traction,"I not only suffer from neck pain for the past few years. I was recommended traction by my doctor and spent several months at PT. The therapist did traction using her hands while also assigning me exercises to build the muscles in my neck. Overall, the muscles become better but I continued to suffer from vertigo and have pain. I started to investigate these gadgets for doing traction on my own. Of course the ultimate are the $300 electrical machines. Considering what I paid for in PT, maybe that would have been a better investment. This model had good reviews so I took a chance. I read that some users with TMJ had difficulty. Some users also tweaked the unit to reduce jaw pain. Following this advice I purchased a few parts at a hardware store. This reduced the pressure on the side of the jaw. That said, the unit is holding on to to the back of your head and under your jaw as it lifts up your head. I'm sorry to say that even with my tweaking of the machine, I was having pain in my jaw. It does help the neck. Can't say it is a night and day difference. I proceeded to use the units several nights and worked my way up in weights. After 1 week my TMJ was flaring up.

Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer,"Performance-wise, this is probably trimmer on the market. The stock blade is sharper than any other blade I've used as is. However, this is NOT a beginner tool by any means. This blade took me several attempts on several different occasions to properly zero-gap, meaning to get it to a point where it won't break the skin and won't compromise performance. Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch. I probably would not recommend dragging this blade along your skin, right-side up & zero-gapped, as you will probably injure your client. I'm sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period. If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line. If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box.

Manhattan toy Baby Stella Doll,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 month old daughter. I thought it would be the perfect 'first doll' for her. The look on my daughter's face was priceless when she saw Stella. Her face lit up and she had the broadest smile ever. She hugged her and could not stop giving her 'kisses'. It was so worth it. Stella stays in her crib until she falls asleep. She used to cry herself to sleep but now she just babbles herself to sleep with Stella listening. The dolls face is very intriguing to my daughter. Something about the face puts a smile on my daughter's face each time she sees her.My daughter, if she could, would give this product a 5 but as a parent I gave it 4 because of several factors. The velcro on the doll's dress opens easily by a 9 month old. Also, whenever I get the doll out the crib after my daughter falls asleep, strands of her hair come undone from the ribbon. When Stella begins to look unkept, I loosen the string holding the hair, tighten and neaten her hair and then feed it through the ribbon which does not loosen. the ribbon is fixed in a loop and bow so a child can't undo it and potentially choke on it.All in all, it's a very cute and soft doll.

Maybe on my next physical I will get a comparison and post the variance (if any) back here.In my opinion the greatest thing that this product does is let you rest which overall increases your workout.

Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,"We gave the Drinkwell Platinum fountain to the cats for Christmas. We sprinkled catnip all over the box before wrapping it, thinking that would tip them off to the box of awesome awaiting inside. No dice. They walked up to it and rubbed against it, but wouldn't unwrap it. So we tore the paper open a little bit and dropped some tuna in there. They went for the tuna, but couldn't figure out how to peel the wrapping paper back to get the rest of the tuna out. So much for that experiment. We just decided to unwrap it for them so we could set it up.The fountain was easy to fill and set up. A few other reviewers have complained about charcoal dust from the filter getting loose and settling in the bottom of the fountain, even though they followed the directions and rinsed the filter. So far, we haven't noticed any such problem, but I think it depends highly upon how you rinse the filter. If you just hold it under running star, very little water will go through--most of the water just goes around the filter. Instead, hold the filter right up against the nozzle on your faucet, so the water has nowhere to go but through the filter.One of the cats seemed scared at first. He kept walking up to it, but seemed kind of freaked out and walked away. Maybe he just didn't understand what witchcraft could put a small stream and pond in the living room where there was previously no abundant source of fresh water. Within a few hours we saw him licking water from the top of the stream, but he didn't drink much. I think he likes it to the extent that it's his water bowl, but he doesn't seem to care whether he's drinking from a luxury $50 pet water fountain or a $5 ceramic bowl.The other cat was immediately intrigued by the fountain. He stared at it for a little while, then started drinking from it. He drank...and drank...and drank...and drank...for about 2-1/2 minutes. Then he left for a minute and came right back to drink some more. I'm not sure if he drank so much because he doesn't usually get to drink water in the living room, or because of the fountain, but either way, he likes the fountain. He seems to prefer drinking from the pool rather than the stream.One thing we had kind of hoped was that the fountain would be enough of a novelty that the cats would want to drink from that instead of any other water source they find around the house. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have any effect on that. Now that the fountain is in the ""cat room,"" it just can't compete with the convenience of having water in the living room (in my drinking glass) or the novelty of a big porcelain bowl of water in the bathroom.Overall, I guess the Drinkwell fountain is nice because it holds quite a bit of water and you don't have to change it out every day. But with the added cost to operate (electricity + filters), it really is just a luxury that your pets may or may not care about. If you want to get your pets a water fountain, this one seems to be a pretty decent one. I guess we'll see how long it lasts. If it runs for several years without any problems, I'll be happy, but if it dies in less than 3 years as some people have reported, I'll probably bump it down to 1 star.It would be nice if they added a timer so it would run for a few hours, then turn off for a few hours--I'll probably get a separate timer at some point and plug the fountain into that. I also wish they had a porcelain version instead of plastic, but I'm sure they would charge at least 3x as much for that model.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'feeding watering supplies')"

I'm sure if I continuously put the squirrels back in after he got them out it would seem he was playing more actively with it, but I just do it once then let him have the squirrels. My dog always chews soft toys to shreds very fast, but for some reason he takes ""care"" of these squirrels and the stump is very thick and well made. I am very happy with this toy and my dog is too!

I have ordered my Frontline direct from Amazon LLC (never a 3rd party vendor) for over two years and never had a problem, until now.When I initially opened the package I found the blister packs were different then normal, not necessarily a big deal as manufactures regularly change their packaging. However, when I cracked open the vile the smell of the product was noticeably different so I decided to contact Merial directly and see if they had changed their packaging. The Merial rep said they had not and asked me to confirm several other aspects of the packaging. The serial numbers actually matched correctly for the US product however she agreed the blister pack sounded odd so she asked I mail them the remaining viles and box for evaluation; Merial case # 12-117630 for any doubters.On January 10th I was contacted by Merial and they confirmed that the product is counterfeit and a very good one with matching serial numbers! To be fair to Amazon I contacted them today and they have refunded my money however there could be many other customers that have made this purchase and received fake product putting your dog at risk of flea infestation. I put my dogs on Comfortis as a precaution and will continue to do so until I can again find a reasonably priced supply of Frontline Plus that is not counterfeit.It is important to note the Merial rep said they do not have a direct working relationship with Amazon and the supplier is a 3rd party.

Wonderful stroller for aby and older child. Well made. Holds enough down below but not a huge bag. I highly recommend. Easy to put in trunk but my only con is that it does not stand up alone when folded and no cup holder.",baby products,strollers,tandem,"('baby products', 'strollers', 'tandem')"

Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,"I've been searching for an X-Large bed for so long! Most of the &#34;X-Large&#34; beds that are being sold are just too small. I have a 165 lb. German Shepard and before this bed the poor guy had to pick which part of his body he would put on the bed. He ended up using most of them as pillows for his head. He fits on this bed with room to stretch out and has a bit to spare. Wonderful!! But if your dog is not an &#34;X-Large&#34; you might want to go a size smaller. My dog can easily rest his head on the kitchen counters, you do not have to bend over to pet him, and occasionally grabs the couch by an armrest to drag around the living room for fun.",pet supplies,dogs,beds furniture,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'beds furniture')"

It has long since been sold, and the memorabilia came from the Uncle who recently passed on,and who never married.The Salerno - Magowan Cookie company, as it was first known, was famous for the EQUIPMENT Mr. Salerno made to create the cookies. We have a multitude of patents on files for making Windmills, Butter Cookies, and even a few machine patents that were very old and were granted by the Third Reich of Germany (Complete with swastika!)Later on Mr. Salerno was persuaded to stick with the cookies and crackers. Many a morning as I was growing up in Niles I would smell the baking of the cookies just a few miles away!

Lastly I dropped in the pound of hamburger and pulsed a few seconds for a nice fine texture for meatballs and meatloaf. It worked beautifully. It also did a great job mincing onion, slicing celery and grating cheese. That's all I've tried so far, but it's worth the price for that.

Cabin Kennel Pet Carrier #060 - Tan,"After much searching online for suitable in-flight, hard-plastic carriers for my two rabbits for an international flight, I finally came across this one. It perfectly matches United Airlines travel requirements for ON-BOARD travel (as stated on their website, ""The maximum dimensions for hard-sided kennels are 17.5 inches long x 12 inches wide x 7.5 inches high (44 cm x 30 cm x 19 cm)."")I ordered two (one carrier for each rabbit) and they arrived within ~3 days. The actual brand I received is ""Aspenpet"" cabin kennel for pets up to 10 lbs. It also came with a 5-year warrantee sheet, which is nice. These carriers are each roomy enough for my two rabbits (one is 5 lb. mini rex/lionhead, the other is a 4 lb. lionhead). These are medium sized/small-sized rabbit breeds.It comes with a thin but flexible cardboard sheet/board inside, which measures 15 inches long by 10 inches wide. This is important for me because I want to buy appropriate absorbent liners so if my rabbit pees/poops on the long flight, the smell/liquid would be absorbed and keep them clean. I am still looking for appropriate liners. The hinges are metal reinforced with plastic, and look very durable.You slide the dark charcoal handles inwards in order to OPEN the carrier. Press down the top of the carrier if it's getting stuck; this helps the handles to slide smoothly outward or inward.I also like that there is a small opening on the metal part (top of carrier) that slides in and out, so you can have access to give your pet food (i.e. pellets or greens) or pet your animal to soothe/calm it. This opening measures ~4 inches by ~4.5 inches.

Playmobil Security Check Point,"Generally, this is a good product for teaching children to obey people who say you should obey them, which of course is how to be a good citizen and everybody knows it.Unfortunately, the plastic is a lower grade than it should be. When my daughter was unable to make one of the terrorist passengers confess and applied a heated piece of coat hanger wire to the terrorist traveler's face, instead of divulging the lies he was withholding, his face melted. Very disappointing given the strength of other plastics on the market. If we are going to use this as a teaching tool, we need to think in terms of the future here.We also quickly became aware that the nice security agents needs to give out audible voice commands to help children learn the cues for future submissive behavior. For example, when the TSA agent gropes the old lady in the extended pack, he should shout, ""Either you do it, or I will have you arrested! Do you want to fly to see your children or spend tonight in a cold cement jail cell?!!""There were other areas lacking realism, but that one seems an easy fix for later upgrades now that batteries have gotten smaller and speaking dolls are common.I'd also have preferred not to pay so much extra just to get the working handcuffs and the holding cell for the traveling terrorists our children help apprehend to make the collective better.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets,"('toys games', 'action toy figures', 'playsets')"

Beautyblender and Blendercleanser Combo,"I had avoided liquid foundation as an adult because of horrible memories from high school of looking spackled instead of dewy. But after a makeup consultation at Sephora, I ended up purchasing Make Up Forever water-based foundation, which matches my skin perfectly and goes on extremely light (it also smells faintly of rosewater, making it extra lovely!).Next I needed a makeup sponge, and was loathe to buy those little white round or square ones -- I hate the way they become so discolored from use and everything about them just feels &#34;not fresh&#34; to me. When I saw these, with their nice egg shape and hot pink color, I thought I'd give them a shot, and they are wonderful.The cleanser is amazing, and gets the foundation right out, so the sponge stays a nice bright pink and never feels dirty. And the sponges themselves are fantastic. I use one wet for overall coverage, and then use the dry one to dab a bit extra under my eyes or anywhere else that needs a bit more attention. The end result is great. They're totally worth the money, and the little plastic container they come in makes it easy to pack for travel as well.",beauty,tools accessories,makeup brushes tools,"('beauty', 'tools accessories', 'makeup brushes tools')"

My hair is naturally dark brown but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times. When I used this the first time, I can't lie I was disappointed.

Slumber Pet Thermal Cat Mat,"Our kitty cat couldn't get to use this mat because the gray-and-white cat on the display picture wouldn't get off the damn thing!

Our small cat grew up quite timid (definately not abused, that's for sure!) and highly strung. No idea why she turned out that way, just seemed to be a personality trait. Anyway we thought she'd like this but at the time we didn't know it would make scrunchy noises when touched (the mat, not the cat) lol. As soon as our curious kitty got onto the mat to check it out it made the scrunchy noise and she very nearly bolted off it so fast it made her heads spin!Needless to say she wasn't too impressed with it. She prefers quieter mats that don't threaten to attack her with noise when she lays down.After several months we eventually found her sleeping on it quite comfortably by the window in the sunlight which surprised us, but it was quite rare she would use it after that, she just never cottoned to it. Yes....she still prefers the bed. This mat is probably suitable for some cats but not for skittish kitties like ours.",pet supplies,cats,beds furniture,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'beds furniture')"

MTL Polishing Cloth Kit,"I am a watch collector, and a large portion of my collection consists of watches built from stainless steel. Over the years many of my watches lost their shine and built up dirt so I decided to search for a product that would be great for cleaning and also polishing so I can bring out the beauty of the time pieces again. After doing hours of research and speaking to other watch collectors, majority recommended me this Item. At first I did not expect much due to the low price, however once I cleaned and polished my time pieces using this product, I must say it brought out their true beauty again, removed dirt and even some little scratches around the body of the watches. This product is absolutely incredible and a must have for anyone who is in need to polish items that are crafted from stainless steel. The best aspect of this item has to be how strong the pre moistened polishing cloths are. I cut about two little pieces off one polishing cloth and that was enough for me to polish 15 watches. Since we are provided with twelve 4"" x 6"" cloths, I can estimate that this amount will last me for years, so for the price it is a phenomenal buy.

Our dog would mostly walk beside us which we accomplished with obedience school and a regular &#34;choke chain.&#34; Now we have switched to the Gentle Leader and she walks right next to us with very little correction.As with many things, it seems trial and error is the best way to figure things out.

Bontempi - Saxophone,"I used to play sax so wanted to get the grand kids started on the concept. Of course, for this price this sax teaches nothing in terms of fingering on a real sax. It is just a series of keys each of which must be held down while they blow into the mouthpiece. That is OK for a small child. My complaint is that if this is made for a small child, why is it so fragile? The ""springs"" that make the keys work are not even springs at all. They are the thinnest of plastic in the mold and are extremely delicate. As soon as one of these thin plastic ""springs"" break, the instrument is now worthless to try to play notes. Just as the kids were learning to play the most basic song, the spring breaks, making the whole thing junk. No, I would not again buy a child's toy that was designed to break within the first week. The only education is for me to know better next time. Optionally, I have found that some of the inexpensive keyboards are surprisingly well made and provide a great introduction to music.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,"('toys games', 'dress up pretend play', 'pretend play')"

TetraFin Flakes,"I've been keeping Fancy Goldfish for close to 40 years and if I've learned anything about these marvelous creatures it's that they need all the room you can provide, massive water changes and wide variety of sinking foods.Here are the ingrediants for TetraFin:Fish meal - You want to see a specific fish named such as salmon meal or white fish meal (as with all pet foods) ""Fish meal"" means the MFG is using whatever is cheapest at market including rancid diseased fish and fish by products.Ground brown rice - The first three ingrediants of ANY pet or fish food should be a specific animal protien - period. Rice is a filler used for weight and volume to the packaging.Torula dried yeast - cheap protien enhancerOat meal - binding agent and fillerShrimp meal - Excellent but is only found in trace amounts in this foodWheat gluten - The number one source for pet food related deaths and recalls in the past 20 years. Works as a binding agent and artifically pumps up crude protien percentageSoybean oil - Few Omega fatty acidsFish oil - Again you want to see a specific fish named like salmon. When a specific animal isn't mentioned it means the manufacturer is buying whatever is cheapest at the time. What is more, this leaves them free to use rancid and diseased fish.Algae meal - Excellent but in very low arounts here.Sorbitol- Artifical sweetner makes food more palatable to fish, can be potentially toxic.Artifical colors including yellow 5, red 3, and blue 2, - Zero nutrional valueethoxyquin. - Ethoxyquin is usually listed as a ""preservtive - however it's a lethal pesticide. The FDA has banned from dog and cat foods. Studies show ethoxyquin is especially lethal to fish. research Google or simply look it up on Wiki-Pedia and follow the links to the research findings.What is more, flake foods should be avoided at all costs. Most Fancy Goldfish especially deep chested fish like Oranda, Ranch and butterflys are all extremly susceptable to bouyancy issues and swim bladder disease. One of the significant causes of this, is the taking in of air. That said your fish are infinatley better off with sinking foods.Much better commercial foods include those by ZooMed, Aqueon, Omega One, New Spectrum and Hikari.",pet supplies,fish aquatic pets,food,"('pet supplies', 'fish aquatic pets', 'food')"

A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers. I know this because I've reapplied every couple hours on a healing area from removing a mole and this is when you experience flaking... not from one layer of covering your face. It really makes my face feel healthy and tight. It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it.

Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion,"I found a sample size of this stuff at Target on a Clearance Endcap. Thought I'd try it. As the title states, I've struggled with dyshidrotic eczema for the last 20 years. This caused my hands to be sensitive and peel, and at worst ache and crack. When it flares up, as it does during dry weather or when I use a allergenic product, small itchy blisters develop and make my skin hurt. During the winter it was especially bad, even though I wear gloves from the first nip of fall. The only solution was a cream that made my hands greasy and smell awful.As soon as I put this on I was hopeful. It soaks in, but does leave a light protective layer on my skin, to protect it from redrying. Some call this greasy, but it's really not, I can open a jar shortly after using it, but there is definitely something protecting my skin. The protection will last through a handwashing, although not much after that. (I don't experience the dryness afterward, even though all traces of the stuff are gone)Needless to say, we have no fewer than five bottles in circulation (at work, next to my bed, on my desk at home, on the kitchen sink and in my car) I've used this as the moisturizer in my paraffin bath, and it's amazing. I'd recommend it for anyone. It works for my daughter's hands that get dry from the school soap, as well as my husband, who uses Skydrol at work all day which wreaks havoc on his hands. I've also used it in spots on eczema on other areas of skin and it soothes it right up.It's a bit thick to use as an allover body lotion for me, but the price compared to what I've used in the past and efficacy for my hands are enough.",beauty,skin care,body,"('beauty', 'skin care', 'body')"

Thera Cane Massager,"This product is interesting to me. Maybe I don't know how to use it very well, but I can't see how this would offer &#34;fixes&#34; to my issues.

I come away feeling pretty good, but the back pain is still there, just not so irritating. I guess what I'm getting at is this isn't some miracle tool that will fix your aches and pains. I'm going to have to make some lifestyle changes I'm sure, just not really sure where to start. If you have aches, and you don't mind spending a decent portion of your day rubbing your own back, this tool is nice. I find that standing up is the easiest way to get at my shoulder blades. I have tried using it on my neck, but the plastic nubs that you're supposed to use have sharp edges because of the way the cane is made (manufacturing flaw).

"Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup Mix, 9 Oz.,","Here's my personal recipe I've used for the past 14 or so years whenever I make this. I find it's WAY WAY better than following the label.You need:One 9 oz. package Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup MixOne 14 - 15 oz can diced tomatoesOne 14 - 15 oz can tomato sauceTwo 8 oz packages fresh sliced triple washed button mushroomsDisregard the instructions on the soup package. :)Open the can of tomatoes and pour them into a strainer. Use a spoon to scrape the strainer to help drain excess liquid off. Canned diced tomatoes come in many different types and seasonings. I recommend just plain Hunts or Del Monte diced tomatoes.Put 8 cups of your favorite spring water in a 4 quart pot. Salt and pepper the water, and add any other of your favorite seasoning (I use hot pepper flakes).Bring the water to a boil, then add the strained tomatoes, tomato sauce (I use Contadina), and both packages of fresh sliced mushrooms. (It will look like it's overloaded with mushrooms, but they will GREATLY reduce in size by the time cooking is done.) Start a kitchen timer for 20 minutes. Cover, wait until boiling starts again, then reduce heat to medium and partially uncover the lid so that you get a constant light rolling boil. Wait for the 20 minutes to expire.Now add the soup mix. Start another 20 minute timer. Stir until boiling starts up again, then again partially uncover until you have a constant light rolling boil, and wait for the second 20 minutes to expire.Turn off the heat, and transfer to an appropriate 10-12 cup heat resistant container.Cover the container and place in the refrigerator. You *can* eat it right away if you want, but after waiting a day, the mushrooms, tomatoes, and all of the ingredients from the soup mix will fully ""plump,"" marinate, and absorb the flavor. You can then reheat it and have the tastiest tomato-mushroom-barley stew ever!This same recipe / procedure also works very well with Bear Creek's Minestrone soup mix.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,"('grocery gourmet food', 'pantry staples', 'canned jarred food')"

The color is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars. It is a very light, kind of milky pink color. It just looks different then I had imagined it to look, even though I had viewed swatches of it and seen people wear it in blogs and stuff.

Some other people have written here not to use the chair in rocking mode with infants of this age, but this isn't really made obvious, and I naively thought that since the product says 'safe up to 40-lb. toddlers', it was engineered to not tip over.

The handle provides a good grip, although I think it might be a bit short for larger hands. I have hands the size of an 8th grader's (I've checked), and it was just right for me.The brush did away with crud on my shower tub that I've been working at for years, as well as mildew and mold on an old shower curtain that I nearly gave up on (don't ask me why we kept it. I don't know). These are both things that I must have invested hours of time and energy on over the last five years with middling results, and with the brush I took care of them in less than half an hour.Color me amazed.",health personal care,household supplies,cleaning tools,"('health personal care', 'household supplies', 'cleaning tools')"

I mention this because this particular long neck might seem a bit small in relation to the other toys in the Carnegie line, but Saltasaurus actually was rather modestly sized compared to other dinosaurs.

Chris Benoit Action Figure,"My reasons for writing a review on this figure, the Jakks Deluxe Aggression version of Chris Benoit, are twofold.

And of course, Jakks line of 'Deluxe' figures, first for WWE and now TNA, remain the coolest wrestling action figures by a large margin.The 2nd reason is the primary one, however; the only actual inspiration for this review is to fix the absurd one-star rating given by a clueless customer. His reason for the low rating is because he didnt receive it on time.

"Kalencom Laminated Buckle Bag, Cream Corduroy","I have 19 month twins and ever since they were born I have been searching for the perfect diaper bag. I had the Ju Ju Be Prepared when they were first born, but once we got past needing 6 bottles every time we left the house, and a million outfits, it was just too large. Brilliant bag, and I would recommend to any multiple Mom for the first six months or so. But ever since I have been searching for our next diaper bag. So many others were too small for twins. I'm also a organizational freak, I keep everything very neat and organized. I like to travel light, but at the same time be prepared for anything. Would have loved the JuJu BFF, but far too small, even for a singleton if you like to be prepared. And the Be All has that stupid flap for a Mommy Pocket. I ended up with the Be Mighty, which is great value, and worked for a while when I could attach it to the stroller, but once the girls were toddling and I wasn't using a stroller to get them from a to b it was just annoying, slipped off my shoulder constantly. Will still use it for swimming trips, spare clothes in the car etc, but just not as our every day diaper bag.This doesn't have a Mommy pocket, or many compartments inside, but it is fantastic quality, looks completely gorgeous, and is a brilliant size. I just have everything inside it in different color wet bags/pockets etc, and it stays organized brilliantly. The pockets on the end are too small for bottle's, sippy cups, but great for keys, lip balm, band aids, toddler snacks etc. I was very pleased by the quality of the bottle holder that comes with it, as well as the wet bag. The &#34;hot pink&#34; corduroy isn't too bright, much nicer color than I was expecting - chose that one because I got it for $23 dollars as a warehouse deal. Wasn't expecting to like it so much, the quality is just fantastic, would have paid $100. Really like the thick long strap. Now that my twins are toddlers I needed a bag that I could sling over my shoulder and wear messenger style while I take a toddler by each hand. I did consider a back pack for a while, but I needed to be able to continue wearing the bag and still access what was inside, while keeping toddlers close, so messenger style it was.Has stroller straps included with the bag, they are sewn into the bag and tuck neatly inside.

Geritrex benzoin compound tincture for skin protectant - 1 oz,"Benzoin tincture of benzoin is typically used as a treatment for damaged skin. It is often applied before applying tape or other adhesive bandages, especially if you have to keep taping and re-taping the same area. I use it slightly differently. I have a friend who is an avid skier and applies Benzoid Tincture to avoid blisters from skiing boots. When I told him about a corn I have on top of one of my toes which is irritated by otherwise very comfortable shoes, he suggested I start using a bit of Benzoid Tuncture on top of my toe. Since Benzoid tincture is often used as an antiseptic (due it the benzoin as well as its alcohol solvent) I felt safe using it on a corn that was irritated. I found that the compound really helps. Now my corn feels less irritated and less painful.I am attaching a photo that shows an open container of the benzoin tincture (photo can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo). The content is a dark brown thick liquid that hardens a bit as it dries. A small hole in the cap allows you to dispense a small amounts. The liquid does stain if you spill it as I found out the first time I applied it to my toe. Now I put something under my foot as I apply the compound.Overall, using it on my toe every day made me more comfortable and I recommend it.Ali Julia review",health personal care,health care,first aid,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'first aid')"

Truthfully when I buy a magnified mirror I do NOT want it to come with a regular mirror at all. All bathrooms have regular mirrors so why would I need another one - esp a small one? Anyway I would like this a lot more if the magnified mirrors were back to back that way I could mount it on the wall and have access to both magnified mirrors.

"Sally Hansen Insta, Dri Insta, Dri Anti, Chip Top Coat",I love painting my nails and have been stuck on doing my own French manicure lately. I wasn't using a top coat per se. I was just using Sally Hansen Diamond Strength hardener as a top coat but that wasn't working out all that great ( its not a proper top coat polish i know) My polish was chipping within a day forcing me to do constant touch ups. I got on amazon and decided to give the Sally Hansen insta-dry anti-chip top coat a try. (I also got some good tips from product reviews) I remove all the old polish with polish remover. Wash my hands really well with soap and water. Dry completely. I put a light layer of the diamond strength hardener and let it dry (only takes a few minutes) then I apply whatever color I want. Top it off with the insta-dry anti-chip polish and I'm good with no chips for a good week or so.The thing is that the directions say apply nail color. Wait two minutes. Then apply one layer of the top coat and it will dry to the touch in 30 seconds. This is true. IF you only apply one layer of color. If you apply two layer of color and then apply the top coat it's not quite dry to the touch in 30 seconds. But when it does set...it sets good. I like it. Leaves my nails hard and super shiney.,beauty,makeup,nails,"('beauty', 'makeup', 'nails')"

The Doggie Catcher for Cars,"First of all, do not use this as a safety harness; it even says on the package that it will not keep the dog safer in an accident. What it DOES do is keep the dog from roaming around your car, or jumping out as soon as you open the door. But we have had a few times when we have had to brake quickly, and it kept our dog from flying toward the front seat, so it did keep her (and us) safe in those cases. We wish we could use a dog safety harness, but she just won't wear one... so this was the next best thing, since we could use it with her current harness.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'collars')"

Now I just wash 2x a week or less. This is truly a luxurious conditioner and a little goes a LONG way!!! I usually the size of a dime to a nickel and my hair is long, down to the middle of my back. Definitely worth the money. But add it to your wish list and watch for the pricing. Can range from $17-25 a bottle. I waited until it was around $18. One down fall--the design.

We decided to try it out, and got somewhat mixed results in the beginning.After getting a bit more experience with the wrap, we found that the most important thing was to make sure his legs were properly and comfortably folded underneath his bottom. Secondly, we've found that keeping the wrap looser works better for him to nap easily. I used to try make it as snug as possible, but found that this makes it very difficult to keep his body straight (which makes me have to keep my body in a weird position).Overall, this is probably one of the best purchases we've made for our little boy.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers,"('baby products', 'gear', 'backpacks carriers')"

It also works to keep the odors inside and my cat loves have a private little place he can go into. My cat is 15 pounds or so and I purchased the extra large just to be sure he would absolutely have enough room. It fits him perfectly, he can turn around and get to different parts of the box. I would definitely suggest getting the alrger sizes no matter what though because it is just more sanitary for the cat.I have not had any issues with the tabs becoming loose or falling off when I roll the box nor have I had any litter spill all over the floor like some other reviews claimed. You just have to roll slowly and it will work just fine. I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of scooping, smelling, or seeing their cat's litter. Guests will come over all the time and inquire about, always impressed at how easy and efficient the process is.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,"I had the clippers for a few days before I used it. I was rereading the instruction sheet (which includes pictures as well as text in 2 languages on how to cut hair) hoping that the info would soak in. The first thing that I shaved off was my (several inches long) winter beard. The clippers took it down to a 5 o'clock shadow before I thought I even got started. No scratches, nicks or skin irritation and I was easily able to shave the rest off with a regular razor.Next I attempted to cut my own hair per the instructions and did pretty well for a first time. I missed a few places on the top back of my head. My sister-in-law who uses this same brand of clippers to cut my brother and their kids hair finished it up and in time with practice I should be able to do it, although I suspect that the back of the neck will have to be finished by another person.I normally pay including tip $17 for a similar haircut at Fantastic Sam's. So with the next cut it will have more than paid for itself. It seems like it will last a long time. A small container of blade oil is included.

"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack","You take it 3 times a day with meals. It works by blocking the fat molecules from being absorbed. Where does the fat go, you ask?

It's like no other BM you've ever had. When you wipe, it's all red pepper infused olive oil. Think about trying to wipe oil off of a frying pan using paper towels. It takes a lot of paper towels to wipe off all that oil. Oh, and again, it's a &#34;lubcricant&#34;, so think about that how ever you wish.This product doesn't deny any of this oil leakage, and in fact, you really should expect it based on the description and function of the product.

Capisette 60 Caps Natural Edema Balance Stop Swelling,I bought this product to reduce the inflammation in my calfs due to what my doctor calls Periphereal Edema.

As a diabetic...the one thing I don't need is a pill that is bad for my kidneys. So in an effort to reduce the use of these harmful drugs in the amount prescribed....I went to Dandelion Root and bought some neoprene compression sleeves...which seemed to help. Bought the Capisette on 12/28/2012 and have been taking double doses of it since then...and the results so far are more immediate than the things my doctor prescibed. The swelling is going down and the color is returning to my skin. The spots are drying out and itch occasionally.

Emmy lives for laser beams and her squirrel. I think the larger size of this makes it easier and more fun for her to attack, and the big bushy tail makes it more fun for her too. I don't know if it's more realistic, or gets her attention more or what, but I bought a different Kong animal and it wasn't liked as much as this squirrel. Even without the catnip she loves it. We tossed out the first squirrel when we got fleas. She's on her second, and it occurred to me that she'd be devastated if they ever stopped making it, so I got her a back up just in case!!!

Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips,"I've been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.Firstly, the product is simple to use and painless. Simply wet your nose, apply the strip, wait 15 min then remove. If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless. (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min. I've been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was painful.)The best part is the results. This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use. If you use it regularly after that (such as weekly), you'll see a decrease in the amount of dirt in your pores.It's not often that I stick with a beauty product (lotion, shampoo, hair conditioner, etc.) for years at a time, but this is the one product that I always turn back to for deep cleaning my pores.

Konsyl Konsyl Natural Fiber Laxative,"very detailed and graphic description below.a little background on myself. just shows constipation can happen to anyone. im 32 yrs old, male, very active, and in great shape. i rarely eat red meat. i eat a good amount of fiber. most fiber is beans, greens, and brown rice. i take probiotics every day. and i drink alot of water.i have had a history of constipation my entire life. it got so bad, that it is all i would think about the entire day. is going to the bathroom and how much better i would feel if i did. because my stomach had so much pressure and hurt. i didnt feel like being active. i was going to the bathroom maybe once or twice a week. alot of the time due to some sort of laxative. and when i did, it didnt feel satisfying. it would be very thin poop.i came across konsyl and after reading the reviews i had to try it. i read this in one of the other reviews and it really helped me. so im gonna put it in caps. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BY FAR IS TO KEEP TAKING THIS FIBER EVERYDAY TWICE A DAY FOR ATLEAST 2 WEEKS. its gonna bloat you, maybe give you some stomach pain, and definitely give you gas. but it will start working.i was severely constipated when i started taking konsyl. i took it 3 times a day (before breakfast, before lunch, 2 hrs after dinner) for the first week. after 48 hrs i finally went. and i went alot. then next day i went alot more. at first it was diarrhea then after a couple of days it became a more solid stool. and i couldnt believe the size and circumference of the stool. it was AMAZING! haha. finally i felt relieved when i sat down to go #2.i have been on konsyl fiber for 3 weeks now. i have cut down to taking it once a day (trying to relieve a little of the gas). i usually go #2 everyday, if not then i will go the next. i cant believe how this has changed my life. my mood is alot better. my energy is through the roof. its even helped clear up some sinus problems i have had. you can drink the fiber in water straight up, but i dont recommend it. i mix it with a scoop of Ultima Replenisher and about 8 ounces of water in a water bottle. shake it up and drink it. and make sure to drink plenty of water during the day.hope this helps atleast one person. happy pooping. &#62;:]",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

"Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)","Not much can really be said about most hot chocolates of this type, and this hot chocolate is no different just because it has a fancy name and packaging, and that the primer uses every adjective available to tell you how chocolate it is. I guess we get to pay more for that type of product privilege.Having been somewhat tongue n' cheek above, hot chocolate tastes better with warm/hot whole milk than mixed with hot water alone as a fast hot drink, duh. This chocolate seems to have a richer flavor mix than the ""no-name bland brands"" found in dollar type stores. Again, you usually only get what you pay for.

Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson,"but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner for(NOT the creamy cake liner, just the regular stuff, the creamy is awful)...but it'll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La Femme.This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this.

Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),"Tim Burton has been recognized already for years to be a master of black comedies with fantastical and weird elements. Beetlejuice is brightly colored early gem in that collection that has been bit forgotten behind darker, later masterpieces. The story itself is however very &#34;Burtonesque&#34; and feels to be close relative of Edward Scissorhands that has similarly abstract, colorful imagery and bit sad undertones behind otherwise brightly colored fantasy world.Here we have Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as newly-deceased lovely, naive couple who want to get rid of family that has settled in their old house - and their desperate attempts lead them to bio-exorcist Betelgeuze, who of course almost manages to wreck everything before bright, happy ending. The whole cast from happy couple to Michael Keaton's demented Betelgeuze to Winona Ryder's goth girl and annoyingly preppy Catherine O'hara seem bit unlikely selections in their roles but that makes them even more charming and fun. And the score of Danny Elfman fits the picture well together with sunny tunes of Harry Belafonte.It is rumoured that there will be sequel for Beetlejuice but I am not sure whether that is a good idea... maybe he should be left to wait in Underworld with his shrunken head and hope that nobody calls his name three times...",grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,"('grocery gourmet food', 'beverages', 'juices')"

Singer Knitting Machine,"Wow! So many bad reviews.I haven't read them all, but the ones I've read made me think.I purchased this exact machine at Walmart for $15 on clearance (got 3 of 'em).I'm a guy and I don't knit, crochet or anything like that.I purchased it to help my daughter increase her production of things that she sells on line.So I bought it with the mindset that I would have to take some time and really try to get this thing to work consistently so I could show her how I set it up and was productive with it.I didn't really read the instructions and I couldn't figure out how the tensioner really worked so I improvised. Had some problems starting out.Turned out to be tension problems.Every problem I've had with this machine is related to tension.You MUST MUST MUST use enough tension for the yarn you are using, but not too much to jam the machine.The instructions seem to a$$ backwards.Not enough tension seems to be causing all the problems they listed.If the needle is splitting the yarn, you don't have enough tension.If you are getting bunches of yarn stuck on a needle or needles, you don't have enough tension.If, when a needle is rising, there is thread on the top of the needle and making it difficult to turn the knob or jamming, you don't have enough tension.If you have so much tension that it's hard to turn the wheel and you are still having problems, you can't use that yarn in this machine.When I first got the machine, I tried the pink and blue eyelash yarn that comes with the machine. What a mess that was.It took me forever to get the yarn off the needles and to pull it all out again.So, I messed with some other yarn (Red heart and some other value yarn from Walmart) and took my time carefully watching what was happening with the needles.This is when I finally figured out how important the tension was.I pulled all the yarn from the ball or skein and put it in a box on the floor, draped the yarn around my back and over my shoulder and through one of the holes in the tensioner and then kept tension on the line by pulling the loose end through the machine and holding it with one hand and turning the crank with the other and leaning forward or backward to keep it tight.I made sure I had two full lines before I went into automatic.So, start slow and make sure your tension is pretty tight.The tension did make the crank a bit hard to turn, but it didn't protest like when it jams.With the proper tension, you can go as fast as you want and I have.Remember the eyelash yarn I talked about. What mess it was? After I got the tension figured out, it actually ran better than regular yarn it looks fantastic.The only problem I see is that it takes some effort cranking this thing and even when everything is working perfectly it will still drop a stitch every once in a while.Now with all this said, I'm only making tubes, flat pieces seem to much more difficult and I haven't tried using the tensioner the way it was designed, but I will be attempting that soon.",toys games,arts crafts,craft kits,"('toys games', 'arts crafts', 'craft kits')"

There are so many to choose from, so I just ordered one. I've been having a visiting nurse for another issue, but she and I have compared my BP with her manual arm wrap vs my wrist cuff. This morning immediately following her reading I used the wrist cuff. The systolic was 17 points higher than her reading and the diastolic was 13 points higher. That's a big difference. I have been writing down which method has been used and made a list for my Dr to interpret, even given the difference in readings.

"Black Currant, Loose Tea and Teabags","I was shocked when I opened the airtight bag and smelled $30 worth of supposedly black currant tea. Nowhere to be found was the pleasing aroma of black currants. Instead, this tea smells like raisins and, when I picked through the tea leaves, I found whole, soft, shriveled raisins, which don't remotely resemble black currants in any way. In fact, there is something called a ""zante currant"" (which is a misnomer) that is really a raisin made from Black Corinth grapes, which are a sweet, seedless table grape. Why anyone would want this in black tea leaves is beyond me. True black currants are a type of berry have a delicious fragrance and are quite tart. In form, they resemble blueberries, but they are a dark purplish-black color. There is another brand of black currant black tea leaves (Peet's) that comes in a tin and is the real thing. It is black tea leaves with bits of dried black currants and it has the genuine aroma of black currants with a delightful tart overtone when you drink it. I can't image what Harney & Sons was thinking when they came up with this blend and called it ""Black Currant,"" but I won't be buying their pricey tea again in any flavor. (I still have a tin of their ""English Breakfast"" that I bought years ago and paid a lot for, only to find that it is redolent of cinnamon, which is not a flavor I want in English breakfast tea.)Anyway, if you like a sweet tea with the overpowering aroma and flavor of raisins, you'll love this tea.

After another month though, it got pretty gross, until finally tonight I threw it away.

Innotek Lap Dog Trainer,"I bought two of these for our two miniature pinschers they have short hair and are very small (about 5-7 lbs) I read that this is the one and only for toy breeds.

The other collar we used the ""1"" setting which is the lightest setting and it made our dog yelp so loud and jump like it hurt so bad. Our dog was shaking and hid under our foot stool and was traumatized. This is not in his nature to be a wussy, min pins are considered tough and the ""King of Toy"" breeds. In the instructions it said a response like that means the setting is too high and may be harmful. The training DVD was not helpful it was based on a different larger product with different controls and for large breeds. This product is too powerful for dogs so tiny.

INTENSIVE CONCENTRATE FOR EXISTING STRETCH MARKS By STRIVECTIN,"I have used this on and off with little results because I never stuck with it. Finally I decided to give it a real test before tossing the 1/4 used bottle (which was expensive, large and takes up a lot of space). I'm so glad I didn't throw it away! I tested it by rubbing a small amount on my left hand, twice a day. I didn't do anything to my right hand. I am Asian, 52 years old and have always had decent skin, but I really noticed thinning of my face and hand skin after turning 49. I don't know exactly how long it took (at least 4 weeks, maybe even up to 2 months; wish I would have written down when I started), but suddenly I noticed that the left hand was noticeably smoother, the wrinkles were finer and the skin felt thicker, even on the knuckles (I didn't put any on my fingers). I never saw this type of result on my face but it was extremely easy to see on the hand because I could hold it up next to the right hand, which still has lots of wrinkles and feels paper thin. If you already bought a tube and have been dissatisfied, try my experiment before you give up! I've started using the cream on my face again, twice a day in the hopes of smoothing out some wrinkles and fading age spots. It's only been two weeks and I haven't seen any results yet, but this time I'm going to stick with a lot longer. My tube has cream (actually more of a lotion consistency) that is slightly tan colored and minty smelling. I can't use it too close to the eye because it makes my eyes water.

I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set.

Source Naturals Coenzymate B Complex Orange,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/jYlSF ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told that CoQ1O is a very powerful antioxidant and neutralises free radicals. It is widely used to support healthy cardiovascular. It also works with vitamin E to protect cell membranes (and particularly immune cell membranes) from free radical attack, thus boosting the immune system. CoQ10 is found in virtually every cell in the body, primarily in cellular mitochondria, and it is a vital component of the electron transport chain which generates 95 percent of the body's energy via ATP. It can cross the blood brain barrier and further studies have shown a protective role in delaying dementia.The Dr told me I should take meds to control my slightly elevated blood pressure (138/93). I tried this. I noticed a small difference in my energy level on just the 3rd day. On the 6th day, I increased to 2 capsules per day and began noticing a difference in my severe allergy symptoms as well. After 3 weeks my BP reading is 122/84.

BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,"There are a few design flaws in this dryer that aren't so annoying that I returned it, but are bad enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Firstly, the temperature and on/off switches are not raised at all so it's difficult to move them--especially when you are right out of the shower and have lotion and/or hair gel on your hands. I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled.

Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,"I bought this since other Mom's I know raved about it. First I paid $50 for what is basicly a HUGE piece of heavy fabric.

If you want to go any where in public with this thing on you better put it on before you leave the house since you will never figure it out once you are away from a mirror. My daughter cried EVERY time I put her in this. She didn't like it at all. The two times I did get her to calm down and stay in it she got over heated quickly even though she was just wearing a onesie. This material is so thick and having that on the baby plus your body heat and your baby will be cooking! I gave up and returned it and so did some of the ladies I know after they had the same issue.

Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets,I love this product!!! I have a 2yr old Labrador. He was diagnosed with FMCP Bi-laterly when he was nine months old. For people who don't know this is one form of elbow dysplasia and he has it in both elbows. Needless to say I was a little freaked out. I was conscerned that I would have to put him down before the 12-15 years I had planned to spend with him had passed. It broke my heart that I might only have my pup for 5-8 years. My puppy's SportsVet recomended this product. He is doing great and I know that this product is not only reducing the progression of his condition but because he doesn't miss a day it is acutally going to extend his life.My Lab will even beg for one because he thinks these are treats. I don't know if all dogs would like them but if you own a 'foodie' dog they certainly wont' refuse them.This is truely a very affordable product. After the first weeks (4-6?) the dosage is one tablet per day for my Lab is one tablet per day. This means my bottle lasts for 150 days. When you divide the dosage (1 chewable pill) and the amount per bottle (150) by the days used (150) Dasaquin is cheaper than most other products on the market.,pet supplies,dogs,health supplies,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'health supplies')"

I stayed mostly dry all day, not irritated and not embarrassed. I do suggest this for sweat problems even though is states its a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. Apply to wet skin right out of the shower and don't wet the stone. When you wet the stone it starts to erode and causes sharp edges like glass on your tender pits.

Nad's Hair Removal Gel Kit 6 oz. Gel And Accessories,"I'll be using Nad's for the rest of my life, it works so well for waxing my legs and is so easy to use. I have annoyingly coarse, thick hair on my legs & have to shave every day, yep, major pain. Nads just rips the hair right out at the root (I know, sounds painful & it is somewhat but it's worth it to me & you just get used to it), then I don't have to wax again for 2 weeks or more. But the bad thing is you have to let the hair grow fully before waxing, that kinda sucks. Won't work very well to wax short stubble, at least not for me. The wax is so easy to prepare, I just stick the jar in a shallow bowl of hot water, don't let the water get into the jar. Then smooth a thin layer of wax on an area of your leg the size of one of the strips, smooth it on in the direction of the hair growth. Then press it on & tear it off in the opposite direction. Voila, silky smooth. And when you're all done with a leg, the wax just washes right off with warm water, such easy clean up. It's not even really like a wax consistency, more like a thick, clear, green gel. Has a subtle smell, nothing bad. All natural ingredients, another bonus. Here's a tip too...the fabric strips that come with the package are ok but they just don't give you enough. What I do is cut up an old pair of jeans into strips, and a couple inches longer than the ones they give you. Denim fabric works perfect and they stand up well thru washing, the edges will fray but that doesn't matter. I soak them a few minutes in a bucket with warm water to loosen the wax before throwing in the washing machine.

Pampers Swaddlers,I have used both Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry for my newborn. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers (with Baby Dry newborn liquid poop often shot right up the back of the diaper and onto baby's outfit) and the same size in the Swaddler style seems to be a lot roomier than the Baby Dry style. There is a slim indicator strip on the front of the diapers to indicate whether they are wet inside but to be honest by the time I have taken pants off or opened up the onesie to allow me to see the indicator I am already pretty much clear the diaper is wet. One complaint is that the top layer of the inside of the diaper has netting that wicks away moisture (to avoid leaks and keep baby's bottom dry) but also serves to dry poop bits which makes them stick to baby's butt.

Having those tabs made it easy and convenient to change it in public. You could roll all the items into the pull-up and use the tab on the side to hold it all closed. Made for less mess and easier to locate a trash can with if you weren't able to use a restroom for changes. Also made it harder for active children to accidently have their pull-ups open on the sides due to rubbing on clothing. The price is also a little higher than I like. In face it is high enough that occassionally when Kmart, Target or Toysrus have diaper sales it's cheaper, even with tax, to get it from there.

Zoya Nail Polish,"This is one of my very favorite polishes, and I do own many others! The Zoya brand is a low-toxicity nail polish formula, at an affordable price. It applies super smoothly and dries quickly to a shiny finish. This color &#34;Dove&#34; is perfectly named... its a lovely light gray... not quite as light as a true whitish &#34;pastel&#34; gray, but light enough to give a very &#34;fresh and clean&#34; look to the nails, if that's what you're after. It's a full coverage &#34;cream&#34; formula that takes two substantial coats to reach opague coverage. This shade of gray is neither super warm (brownish) nor supper cool (bluish)... to my eye it's a &#34;neutral&#34; gray, so I imagine it would flatter a wide vairety of skin tones, and go with most outfits. I have very fair skin with warm (yellow) undertones. There is no shimmer to the color, but it's nice and luminous. I'd say this color is office appropriate as well, for all but super conservative settings. To me the color says &#34;modern and hip and creative&#34; yet also &#34;reserved and elegant.&#34; I'm really fond of shades like this, that manage to be off beat without being wild or tacky. This shade will get your hands noticed though, so make sure your nails and cuticles are well manicured before applying, clean up any mistakes with a polish corrector, and apply hand cream after the polish dries. I used a good base and top coat as well (Opi &#34;Start to Finish&#34;). My husband really loves this color on me, and he's usually not one to comment on my nail polish.

I poured way more than just 20 drops into the streaming bathtub, about an ounce each day for 3 days and the pest was eradicated. my house smelled wonderful and so did I every night before going to bed after a long, hot soak.

"Horizon Organic Low Fat Milk, Vanilla, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)","Do you know how much a dairy cow weighs on average? How many gallons of water a cow drinks in a single day? You would if you got this Horizon Organic milk.I have a passion for all things drinkable with a straw right out of the pouch, mostly because it saves me from having to creatively squeeze in yet another dirty glass to the pile of dishes already waiting in my sink. This straw that is included in every pouch is this milk's biggest asset, second only to its rich vanilla taste, of course.Nothing like sitting down to watch some News on TV on a saturday morning, with a plate of scrambled eggs in one hand and this 8 oz pack of low fat vanilla milk in the other. You just stick the straw in and enjoy the deliciousness. The rectangular thick paper pouch is just big enough for a nice, easy hold. You feel good holding it, like when you wrap your fingers around the iPhone, or when you hold a handyman's driller or something. Then you take a sip through the straw and you quickly transform into an adult kid of sorts.I get my boxes from Costco. They are cheaper in bulk, of course. They have it in chocolate and strawberry flavors but I always get the Vanilla kind, I don't know why. I do want to try the other flavors though. It is organic milk but frankly, you can't tell if it tastes different from the regular, non-organic milk because of its vanilla flavor or inherent richness. And it's already sweetened so I wouldn't recommend using this milk with cereal that already has some sugar in it. But I do have another way you can enjoy this milk. As a dessert, no less!Pour one pouch of this milk into your ice cube tray. Sprinkle some walnuts and pistachios and dig in a toothpick. 2 hours later, you have yourself a nice frozen treat. Kids will love it too.Judging by the package design, I suppose you would say it's kids' milk. But do you really care? It tastes good, is nutritious enough and quenches your thirst, whether you are young or old. So cheers...to the little kid in all of us.",grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,"('grocery gourmet food', 'dairy eggs', 'milk')"

Boundaries,"I realized this is a book for Christians and it's theories are based on the bible when I picked up two copies for me and my mother to read. We both struggle with healthy boundaries in the workplace and at home. She is a devout catholic and I am an agnostic. I thought it was very interesting how we both ended up hating this book. Using the myth of creation, the story of Adam and Eve, to justify why we take on too much as individuals is asinine. We live in a society that pushes us to be perfect. Even my mother felt that the book was base, silly, and misleading, using biblical quotes loosely and taking many things out of context. The bible is the ONLY book referenced throughout the entire text. In a literate society, you'd think the authors would realize Christians read more than just the bible. With all of the popular literature on social science, health and psychology, they could use something other than an ancient text of myths, legends, and poetry to guide individuals who are struggling with REAL PROBLEMS and REAL RELATIONSHIPS in the REAL WORLD. Instead they rely on the power of old words like ""sin"", ""evil"", ""Satan"", and dangerous notion that boundary issues are a ""Christian"" problem, and thus should be solved strictly in a ""Christian"" form and fashion.",beauty,makeup,nails,"('beauty', 'makeup', 'nails')"

As soon as a hole appeared, one of them freaked out and started going to the bathroom (pee and poo) on the floor. I gave them a lot of time without a hole too. Be aware that when you first start, the cat will probably want to put all four paws on the tray with the litter. And since they've squeezed all four paws into such a tiny space, where does their back end wind up? You guessed it - perched over the seat! So... I hate to paint a picture here, but since their rear-end is over the seat, the pee goes onto the seat, drips all over the toilet and onto the floor! I eventually had to give up on this thing after a number of weeks. I couldn't even make it to the first hole with one of my cats.

Carpet Scratching Post with Feather Toy,"I have two cats. One lets me clip her nails. The other was feral until 6 months, and I got the post for her to stay inside when I trapped and spayed her and she became a bit friendlier while recovering from spay surgery.In the state the scratching post arrives in, I don't think it is a very safe product. More than once, the kitten got her toes stuck in the elastic that holds the feathers to the post. She would scream and I would have to assist in freeing her paw. She also got the elastic wrapped around her, and it's probably possible for a kitten to get the neck caught if the feathers got tangled to the base of the elastic in just the right way and made a loop. On the other hand, the feather and elastic toys will quickly be pulled off of the post by an energetic and engaged cat. So, the post doesn't stay dangerous long, and the kitten seemed to have a lot of fun. I think having her paw caught made her angry so that she wanted to attack the feathers even more. It was also good fun for me to watch her play and not destroy my things. After the feathers got pulled off by the cat, I replaced them with some mardi gras beads that I attached to the bit of elastic still sticking out the top of the post. The beads were much safer. The kitten never got stuck on them, and had fun attacking. She also managed to pull the post over so it fell on her, but it's light and she was much bigger then.Well, the feather toys fell off the post within a month of getting it. It's been 6 months since then, and the scratching post is now just a scratching post with no toy. The kitten (now cat) who this was initially purchased for uses it exclusively to scratch her nails, and does not touch furniture or the apartment carpet. She likes the texture of the post, and she may have gotten used to using it when she was small. (I also rubbed catnip into it periodically during the first months I had it.) The post still looks OK, although it is getting scruffy and bare near the top. I think it will last a year with heavy use from one cat, and minimal use from the other.The cat who lets me clip her nails barely uses the scratching post, and I have to keep her nails trimmed weekly so she isn't at the furniture.In general, I think the post is a little small. For the cat who is bad about using it, I think she likes to reach high above her head and stretch out to scratch, and that is why she wants to scratch on furniture - to scratch on something taller. For the kitten (now cat) who exclusively uses the scratching post, she tends to scratch the square base as much as the post. I notice the entire post slide around on the floor (also carpeting, so plenty of friction and not slick) when she does this. That might bother a cat, and a larger heavier post wouldn't do it.It also sheds small pieces of carpet onto the floor when the cats use it. So, plan on buying one that is the same color as the carpeting around it. I bought at a pet store, and the North American Pet brand had some lighter and darker carpet colors to choose from for this post.Overall, this scratching post was a good buy for the money. The kitten who needed a post got into the habit of using it, and hasn't bothered the furniture since she was very new to the house. If you are worried about safety issues for your cat, then you should immediately detach the feathers by cutting the elastic close to where the elastic attaches to the metal chains. Then replace with a small cut section of mardi gras beads. That makes for a safer cat toy which won't catch the paws or wrap around and catch itself to lasso the cat.",pet supplies,cats,beds furniture,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'beds furniture')"

"Premium Choice Extra Strength with Baking Soda Scoopable Cat Litter, 25 Pound Bag","I thought I already left a review on this, but maybe not. I'm senile like that. Anyhow, I have two senior cats--one male (a.k.a the Stinkinator) and the other female (a.k.a Smells Like Roses). I really like this litter as far as litter goes (can you be excited about litter?). I've tried most brand-name products and most often used Fresh Step, which was alright but way too dusty and expensive, and I also didn't care for the perfume; I just really hated their ""extreme"" version, which was nothing more than extremely useless and too clay-ish. Most other brands just didn't cut it.Although I tried this product several times and liked it, along with the regular unscented (blue bag/container), I recently wanted to give one other brand a shot that was similar, which was Precious Cat. I also did this because Amazon doesn't seem too keen to carry Premium Choice as they do the Precious Cat, as I've been noticing it less and less. So far, I can't wait to be done with the Precious Cat so I can move back to this brand ha. I felt that Premium Choice had better clumping and was less ""muddy"" when my senior male used the box, and I felt that it had much better odor control. Now, don't get me wrong. In order to block out Salem's foul stench, post-defecation or urination, you would need nothing short of radiation cleansing and an Israeli-style gas mask, as well as plenty of time until both cat and nuclear-type fallout cleared, but this product worked fairly well considering. In fact, I noticed far less gusto in his bragging verbal announcements after he went while using this product versus other times. Coincidence? Perhaps, but I'm more pleased that I didn't have to suffer half as much as before, especially considering the bathroom the box is in is open to my bedroom. And is that not disturbingly human male-like, for male cats to announce their deeds? I'll never understand this concept.I have not tried their scented version, but out of the baking soda version (green) and the one without (blue), I definitely prefer the baking soda version--though the blue might work okay for females. However, since it's not perfectly capable of eliminating odors 100% as I would much rather prefer, I also find that it works well to use products like Odorzout powder and/or ZeroOdor spray. Surprisingly, these two products did not help me with the Precious Cat litter, which I thought was strange, and I had scrubbed the 2-month-old box entirely before using it in order to test properly.Again, my cats are passed their retirement years (not that they have ever done much with their existence otherwise, other than stare at me in that inferior-like way, sleep, and eat), so I'm sure this makes a difference, but they go a lot and I clean the box once or twice a day. There is a slight (very slight) odor after several days of use (with cleaning/adding more), but it's more a litter smell than a urine one. The Odorzouts or Zero Odor help this, making it so I don't have to change the litter completely more than every two weeks, but I felt it worth mentioning anyway. The Precious Cat and other brands, however, flat-out smelled like urine within the first day, even after scrubbing their box clean and changing it often, so that was a big points deduction in comparison. Again, it could be my freak of a cat, and I'm sure everyone will experience different things based on their cat's needs. I just feel there's an upside to this product when it comes to odor, personally. The real test was my partner, who really does not like cats and loves to complain about the smell (and sometimes lack thereof). Even he mentioned how he couldn't smell anything, but not so with the other brand I've tried recently.The litter lasts quite a long time and works well in my Omegapaw box, and there is hardly any issue with dust. In fact, it was the least dusty one I've tried yet, which is great. It also seems to do pretty well with not sticking to the bottom of the box so much, which my male seems to enjoy aiming for--more for spite, I think. Since it's not muddy like other products, this helps even more so when it comes to that and it helps me to avoid having to bang on the bottom of the litter box like a congo drum in the early mornings or late at night. I also feel that, out of all the litters I've tried, this one tracks far less. Mind you, it is not 100% perfect in this, but I notice a dramatic difference out of the one I'm currently on, which has me vacuuming several times a day vs. once a day or every two days with the Premium Choice. I have also cut up an old yoga mat to use as a litter trap mat, since I'm way to cheap to buy a specific litter mat, and it seems to work great for that.All in all, I repent and have learned from my folly of using another product and plan to go back to this one soon. It is not perfect, but it so far seems to do the best and I can't afford to buy ones like EverClean. I don't care much for the bags and find them awkward, but that's from my laziness and something that can easily be resolved. I did save the containers from the 16-pound ones though, which does help (in case anyone was debating about that). The price is good though and I personally feel that it works pretty well. I can only hope Amazon will continue to carry the product, because it's not so easy to find. Go figure.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

"KAL - Magnesium Glycinate 400, 180 tablets","Caveat emptor!I first bought this brand and used it for quite a while before realizing that the label is totally misleading! Intentional?! The label shows Mg Glycinate 400 with ""2 Daily"" underneath. Any reasonable person who doesn't have time to double- check that would assume that by taking 2 Daily, one is getting 800 mg by taking 2 daily. No, that is not true! Each tablet is only 200 mg. At the Amazon price of $18.94 the cost of each tablet is 10.5 cents, or 21 cents per 400 mg serving. I switched to Doctor's Best at $15.73 for 240 tablets, each tablet costing 6.55 cents and each $ 400 mg serving costing 13.1 cents! A 35% savings!KAlL brand at 21 cents per tablet is 60% higher in price than Doctor's Best! Been taking d's best for quite a while now and don't notice any difference.

Suave Professionals Sleek Shampoo (14.5 Ounces),"I am currently 14 years old, and I was searching and searching for the right shampoo for my hair. I have tried every shampoo brand out there from Garnier, Matrix, Pantene and Tressemme. I had even spent all of my $60.00 of birthday money on stupid Wen...ha! what a waste that was! All these shampoos that I have tried made my hair oliy, greasy, grimy,flat, and dull. I also suffer from severe asthma, combined with chronic bronchitis and sinus disease, and every time I used these shampoos, I would burst into full-blown wheezing and my nose would run like crazy! Then, one day, I discovered Suave products. I was in the store with my mom, looking like the idiot trying to choose between a shampoo as usual. My hand was reaching for the Tressemme smooth and silky..and then...my eyes spotted this. I bought this along with the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo, and the Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying Shampoo as well. My hair has never been so healthy while using Suave products. My friends (who use Wen)ask me ""what shampoo do you use in your hair? It looks so shiny and healthy!"", I just simply reply,""Suave"", and they just look at me, dumbfounded. Even strangers ask me the same question, and I simply reply ""Suave"" My hairstylist is even suprised of how healthy my hair has become! She asks me as well, ""what do you use to get your hair so sleek?"", here's how it went today when I went:""What do you use to get your hair so sleek?""""Suave""""No...""""Yes!, yes I do""""What else do you use in your hair besides Suave?""""Thats it""""No shine serums..""""Nope""""No straighteners..?""""Nah""""No conditioner?""""No way!""Yeah, thats right..I don't even have to use conditioner in my hair anymore. Before I had to use a ton. Until I used Suave.If you ask me, Suave shampoos are the best thing that have hit the market today. This one (Suave Sleek) is not NEARLY as oliy as Garnier's Sleek and Shine shampoo. This actually clarifies your hair. The smell of this shampoo is great, and, yeah, you might not need conditioner after using this because it makes your hair so sleek without it. If you have thick, straight hair like me, it will make your hair even sleeker and shinier! Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo also works AMAZING as well! Try that out too. Suave really knows how to make an excellent shampoo at a reasonable price range, thats all I have to say! :)Other Suave shampoos I would recommend:*Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint shampoo*Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying shampoo*Suave Naturals Refreshing Tangerine shampoo*Suave Naturals Mango Mandarin shampooHope this helps! :)",beauty,hair care,shampoos,"('beauty', 'hair care', 'shampoos')"

Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it.

The giraffe showed in the picture is looking a lot more straight forward than mine. I don't know if this was a creative TWIST an employee put on it but it didn't work.

It's actually rare that I think something is too salty.

But it does work once you figure everything out. Just don't expect much from an audio/tuning standpoint. This is an experiment in radio theory, not a pleasure radio. At best you may faintly hear one or two nearby stations. But, that is not the point. The point is how radio waves from miles away are able run a radio receiver with no other source of power.This is very similar to what WW2 prisoners of war created in their prisons to monitor allied radio signals. You can construct one of these the size of a cigarette pack and the only manufactured item you need is the diode.

"Prilosec OTC Acid Reducer, Delayed-Release Tablets","I have suffered from GERD since I was in my 20's. (I am now 69.) Prilosec works better for me than Prevacid, Nexium, Zegerid, or any of the other products I have tried. I am taking it every day. I worry, however, about its proved side effects. Apparently, this drug and others like it cause a loss of calcium and consequent breaking of bones in the hip, spine, and elsewhere. Since I have osteoporosis as well as GERD, I am anxious about my dependence on Prilosec. Despite this serious risk, I am taking it daily so that I can eat and sleep normally. I think that objections to the packaging are foolish. Remember what happened with Tylenol! I'd rather have my tablets a little hard to open than worry about their being contaminated by vandals or manufacturers of competing products.

"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige","The pieces do not fit together snugly when assembled. The slide-out waste collection tray leaves gaps that litter falls from when rolling the box to clean. It is very heavy and awkward to roll and, although I tried to clean after first day of use, the wet litter stuck to the bottom of the box and did not fall into the collection tray. So I decided just to remove the lid and scoop the waste as I would for a normal covered box. However, the two pieces of the box do not fit together well, and after several times removing the top to clean the litter, the latches are virtually impossible to line up to get the lid firmly in place. I would not recommend this product and would instead buy another litter box like the second one that I have which has a hinged lid that you can lift up to clean without totally removing it.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'litter housebreaking')"

Q-Gel Mega 100 (100mg Hydrosoluble CoQ10),"Q-Gel Mega 100 was prescribed to me by, essentially, two of the leading physicians in the country who treat the condition I had (fortunately both here in town). The symptoms that this product deals with were unusually quick muscle fatigue, slow recovery from exertion, generalized muscle weakness, and unusual and occasionally painful tightening of muscles at rest. Not fun. While CoQ 10 is the indicated supplement for treating these problems, they both told me that Q-Gel Mega 100 is far and away the product with the greatest bio-availability. (With most vitamin and supplement products, a significant amount of the desired vitamin, mineral, etc. is filtered by the kidneys and is literally flushed down the drain. ""High bio-availability"" means much less flushed down the drain and less stress on the kidneys.)The results of using this product were entirely satisfactory. Over the course of treatment I recovered completely. While the price might seem high, the results I realized make this a flat-out bargain.Personally I would not recommend taking this (and most other vitamins/supplements for that matter) without the advice of a trusted, KNOWLEDGEABLE physician, pharmacist or PhD in the field. Then, when CoQ 10 is indicated, this is hands down the best available formulation of it.As the old tag line said",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,"('health personal care', 'nutrition wellness', 'vitamins supplements')"

The sound effects are good, the lighting on the front and in the fire box are fun, and the overall opertion is great.There are a couple of minor issues on the negative. The track connections are okay, but a couple of the track section connection points had excess plastic in them that required some clean-up with a hobby knife. The only other minor issue is the train car connectors... for younger players, they are a little hard to connect and keep the wheels on the track.Regardless, this is a great set for any fan of the Polar Express!

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This Waterpix is EXCELLENT and I would highly recommend this model if you are considering purchasing a Waterpik for the first time.Pros/Cons:PROS:- it really works well at its task and is actually fun to use- it holds a generous amount of water- not too loud- has great storage compartment in the lid- the cord to the handle recoils back to the same shape and tucks back in just like the picture if you don't over stretch it- nice aestheticsCONS:- it can be messy until you can get the hang of how to let the water drool out of your mouth and into the sink- it's a bummer if you don't finish your routine before the water runs out. After a few uses you get into a pattern of how to clean your teeth fast enough then do retouching with the water that is left overI recommend keeping a plastic 1 to 2 quart water bottle filled with water in the bathroom where you use it instead of detaching the blue reservoir for a commute.OH! and after your done, rinse with mouth wash for an aggressive clean feeling.Also, I found that this product doesn't replace flossing all together because it can't really get between the teeth when the teeth are touching BUT IS MUCH BETTER AT GETTING BELOW THE GUM LINE COMPARED TO FLOSSING ALONE.I recently had a breakthrough in flossing more when I found the new REACH ACCESS FLOSSER!

Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,"I am a woman with small hands, my dog is a boxer mix with large paws and claws. These trimmers are a good size for both of us. I've always used guillotine style trimmers in the past but found them awkward. I find the scissor like action of the Safari trimmer much more comfortable. I adopted my dog when he was 10 months old and for the first year he didn't need trimming. When the time finally came that he needed it, my normally good natured, happy dog growled at me. I don't know if he'd had a bad experience in the past but I wanted to be sure he had no reason to fear the trimmers. So starting out I would just trim one claw followed by a treat and a lot of praise. I would not try again for a day or two and always just one. With the Safari trimmers I could always see where I was cutting and I could take small nibbles so it never hurt him. Pretty soon he was looking forward to trim time and he would hand me his paw. We have gradually worked up to doing a whole paw at a time. He does have soft, pink and white claws, which makes it easier. But I haven't had any trouble with these trimmers crushing his claws.

DREAMATE SLEEP AID by HIVOX,"I bought this because I have had trouble sleeping and I am really a little surprised....but this thing works.It is easy to care for and if used properly, it works for me. I have found I fall asleep faster and even better yet, sleep deeper. I have also found that a couple of times during the day when I wanted to ""calm down"", I put it on and it helped with that too.I think Hivox markets this as a sea-sickness aid as well and I cannot vouch for that. I don't get sea sick but I have a friend who goes on cruises and I am actually anxious for her to try it the next time she goes.I have been using it for a few weeks and I have no rash like others have said (it states if you get a rash to discontinue use) and some people seem to say it hurts. It certainly does not hurt me. It seems to me if it hurts that a person has a REALLY low tolerance to pain. I started with it on the lowest setting and have moved it up to about the middle now.So far, I am very happy.It is not a total ""wear this once and you will sleep like a log"" but it is a device (strange as it may be) to assist you in getting better sleep.If you don't like it, I am fairly sure you could return it but I would recommend people try it out. I am sure everyone is different and maybe it won't work for you but like me, maybe it will and for $50, it has already given me, what I consider to be, it's money's worth.",health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,"('health personal care', 'health care', 'sleep snoring')"

The comb is like a wide tooth comb, and it doesn't pull or snag on the hair. Its a very clever idea, plus it gets those ends that can sometimes become hard and tangled with a regular flat iron. The comb attachment is remarkable!This iron gets hot quickly, but there is no flashing light or indicator that lets you know that it has reached the temperature that you set it at. Beyond that, I have no other complaints. I sold my Sedu to get this, and it was well worth it.Babyliss products are better than I thought, I may check out their other items because of this fantastic flat iron.

Gold Medal Formula 30 with Cardoplex Whitening Shampoo,"My local pet store no longer carries this brand and I was so happy to find it again on Amazon.

Your dog will definitely dry FASTER with this shampoo hands down. I have one dog with silky hair and one with curly hair and they both are brindle and white. It works perfectly for both dogs and they both do not like to be dried so this definitely reduces any stress they experience.My dog with the silky hair texture benefits from the conditioner and my other dog doesn't require it. You need to use very little product to get a good lather and a bottle of this shampoo is long lasting, I ordered multiples to get the free shipping - it is my favorite shampoo of all time.

When you open up the bag you are hit with an amazing smell of peaches, but the candy itself did not live up to expectation. To me they taste kind of rubbery and have an after taste that I don't really care for. They are not soft enough. The peach rings I usually buy also have a lil bit of a sour taste along with the sweet which I like. These are almost too sweet. I have this huge ziplock bag full of them and now I wish I would have just saved my money and bought a few packs of the peach rings I love.

Petsafe-Dog Kennel,"I purchased this item to fence in a six-month old puppy who weighs about forty pounds and is a calm-mannered sweetheart. I read reviews before purchasing, and while one stood out as alarming (the dog who was strangled in the gap at the door) the rest seemed fairly positive, and I knew I could adjust the height of the door to prevent it from being lifted up enough to squeeze a head into.I've worked construction before, and wasn't impressed with the quality of the chain link, which was already in a state of unraveling and had to be rewoven in places. I was even less confident in the metal ties provided to secure the chain link to the frame, and so after attaching them all at the recommended intervals (every five diamonds on the bottom) went through with security grade zip ties and secured in between all of those as well.Best estimates put it at fifteen minutes after I left, my dog escaped. The horrible quality chain link was a cinch for her to unravel and create a hole almost large enough to slip through unharmed. I say almost, even though she did slip through, because she sliced open a large gash about five millimeters from her eye. Fortunately, our backyard is fenced in, so she just hung out there all day until my wife got home, and is now recuperating with some neosporin.I want to send this back for a refund, but I'll need to wait until this weekend to disassemble it completely, and then since it weighs 165 pounds and is a giant awkward mess, it's going to be an enormous hassle to return. I'm extremely disappointed in this product. The other option would be to line the entire inside with chicken wire and cinder blocks, which is going to add a considerable additional expense to this already overpriced piece of junk.",pet supplies,dogs,houses,"('pet supplies', 'dogs', 'houses')"

"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)","I have to preface this review by stating my first job was at a movie theatre. I have been addicted to Theatre popcorn ever since. But trying to recreate it at home has always been a challenge. Even through I knew what it took, to gather all the ingrediants in one place took time. Finally I now have everything available to make the best popcorn outside of the Movies.My husband was a sweetie this Valentines and picked up a Great Northern Pocorn machine as my gift. Let's just say I was elated and floored. This wasn't the table top model, but the full on floor version!! I know...awesome, right? Did I mention how much I LOVE my husband!When i first used it with my own coconut oil/yellow salt/ popcorn it was tasty but something was not quite right. So searching I went. There were a few other versions of these prepackages out there, but I needed something that would cover the 8 oz of our popper, wasn't too expensive and I could buy in bulk. Heck agt this point I could open my own popcorn stand!Easy to use, with a cavet. If you are using the same popper as I have (see above). It's a little tricky to get everything in the popper without some spill. Also my popper requires you to heat the oil first then once heated pour in the popcorn and salt. I definately lost a few kernals the first time. I also have a small cusineart popper someonw gave me as a gift many years ago and received almost daily use (see my other reviews) and this pack works great with that version as well. Even a little easier to get started, but makes a crazy amount of popcorn for that unit. Would have to get the 4 oz packs for that to make more sense.All in all, fantastic tasty popcorn for those non butter/oil lovers out there. I also picked up the &#34;butter&#34; to complete our experiance. Now to look for a butter topping dispenser that doesn't cost a arm!

"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella","As with another review I read, it took 3 barks for my noisiest dog to connect barking with being sprayed. Now when I put it on her, she rarely even tries to bark and she's figured out that if a dog standing next to her barks, SHE gets sprayed (so she moves away). Contrary to what others have experienced, I've had it for over a year and have only changed the battery twice and just now started the 3rd can of spray. If she suddenly starts barking, I know it's time to add citronella or replace the battery. I have 3 dogs ~ luckily only one is a barker (I swear she barks at clouds moving), one rarely barks and one has never barked(!). Shock collars seemed too cruel so this was perfect. Somehow I've misplaced the collar and recently paid full price for a new smaller version for small dogs.

Sunbeam 732-500 King Size Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,"I haven't purchased a heating pad in ages, so it was neat to see that they've kept up with the times. The dial is simple and has 3 levels of heat, and the power cable itself is a good length. This thing can get pretty hot too. I'm surprised how hot the high level can get. It's a good size, as it can cover most of my back when i'm using it. I don't have to keep moving it to different spots.The only drawback is that the blue cloth constantly falls off of it. Its a cheap button that holds it on there. Staying snapped shut is the last thing this button wants to do. So the sleeve keeps falling off and ending up in the couch or whatever. But that itself isn't a big deal, i think its only necessary so the plastic doesn't touch your bare skin if you're into nude heat padding. I usually have a shirt or something on, so its not a deal breaker at all.Also, it seems every heating pad is geared towards the elderly, so if you're young and cool and hip like myself, you might feel a little old with the geriatrically oversized power switch.

The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),"I bought this product because of all the positive reviews on amazon and I have to say it lived up to it! One of the cats just LOVES it. It gets him up flipping around the floor as he chases after the feather bird. I am very happy with the purchase of the single 36&#34; pole because it has held up well to constant play everyday and allows me to store the bird out of reach of pry paws, which is important because as the packaging says &#34;put it away or it will be loved to death&#34;. If I don't put it away he proceeds to carry the feather bird around in his mouth and chew it until he removes all the feathers.A few issues I have with it though:1) The feathers do come out fairly easily. Within the first few days he had already ripped out the feathers so I was glad I bought the super pack with 3. It is however an easy fix. I just hot glue gunned the feathers back in place in the plastic head and so far they have held. I will just keep repairing it this way until the feathers are completely ruined. Make sure however if you do this to put the feathers back in the same positioning they came in (see image in product description). This positioning is what gives the feather bird the great bird like movement and spinning. If you put them back another way it doesn't do this as well.2) The feather clip is attached to the pole by a thin string. This string has two issues. First is that within the first few days it came untied from the feather clip. This isn't a big deal; I just tied it back in place. I do however have to retie it almost every other play session. Second, the string is so thin that the cats can easily eat it. I found this out the hard way the first time it broke. I put the toy down and when I came back the other cat was just chewing on the string and had already chewed through it, so be careful.3) Though I have not specifically noticed the fiberglass splinters people had mentioned I did notice my hand was a little raw feeling after a long period of play flipping the pole around. I fixed it by putting some athletic tape on the end of the pole that I held in my hand. Now I am ready for the hours (and I mean hours) of play the cat desires from this toy everyday!",pet supplies,cats,toys,"('pet supplies', 'cats', 'toys')"

L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System,"This is for color Preference Light Beige Brown (6BB). I was so nervous to try this. I waited until I could not take my GRAY roots anymore.

At salons, I have been begging them to get rid of the brassy tones that ALWAYS show up on my base color, only to be told that is the only way to cover the gray and give me the medium brown with blonde highlights look. WELL WELL WELL!! Hot diggity I am so excited I can prove them wrong. This covered my grays, was NOT brassy and blended perfectly with my highlights (I did a root application for 30 minutes and then strategically pulled the color through my darker strands for another 10). I will only be going to the salon for highlights 2x a year from now on!! And for less than $10!! AND bonus, under an hour....not FOUR at the salon!! I am just thrilled!! (and so is my husband!!)
